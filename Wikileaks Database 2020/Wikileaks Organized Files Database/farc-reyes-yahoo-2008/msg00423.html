<p><b><br>1. Mobilization for Coca-Cola's Annual Shareholders Meeting</b>
</p><p>We are calling on all our supporters to mobilize for Coca-Cola&#39;s annual
shareholders&#39; meeting, which will be held on <b>Wednesday, April 16th,
starting at 10:30 a.m. </b>The meeting is being held at the Hotel DuPont
in
Wilmington, Delaware, the site of the last four annual meetings.
</p><p>The annual meeting is the only place one can challenge face-to-face the
chief policy-makers of the company -- the top executives and board of
directors. By having a strong presence inside and outside the meeting, we
continue to serve a warning to the stockholders, creditors and other
potential investors that they will be held accountable for the
irresponsible actions of this company.
</p><p>The Campaign to Stop Killer Coke is working with individuals, other
organizations and stockholders to hold Coke accountable for its serious
labor, human rights, health and environmental abuses. If you or your
organization would like to participate in or help mobilize for activity
around the annual meeting, contact us at (718) 852-2808 or e-mail us at
<a rel="nofollow">StopKillerCoke!@aol.com</a>.
</p><p><b>Coke's abuses on a worldwide scale include: </b>
</p><p>* <b>stopping the United Nations' International Labor Organization
</b>from "examining violations of workplace rights in Colombia" (Sydney
Morning Herald, 6/6/07);
</p><p>* <b>overexploitation and pollution of water sources </b>in India,
Mexico, Ghana, El Salvador and elsewhere;
</p><p>* <b>continuing to operate in the Sudan</b>, ignoring violence in
Darfur and paying fines for violating U.S. sanctions;
</p><p>* <b>benefiting from hazardous child labor</b> in sugar cane
fields in El Salvador as documented by Human Rights Watch and by the UK's
Channel 4 production, "DISPATCHES: Mark Thomas on Coca-Cola," first aired
nationally in England on November 19, 2007;
</p><p>* <b>aggressive marketing to children</b> of nutritionally
worthless and damaging products;
</p><p>* <b>anti-worker and anti-environmental practices worldwide</b>,
including reports that The Coca-Cola Co. has been accused of benefiting
from prison labor in China;
</p><p>* <b>giving executives hundreds of millions of dollars</b> in
stock options and bonuses while laying off thousands of employees and
turning other employees into non-employees referred to as "subcontracted
or
flexible workers" who receive minimal pay and have no job security or
future with the company.
</p><p>* <b>history of racial discrimination</b>, fraudulent business
practices, tax avoidance and corporate welfare schemes.
</p><p><b>Seeking stock proxies from concerned stockholders </b>
</p><p>Stockholders are now receiving their notice of the annual meeting and
proxy card from The Coca-Cola Co. If you are not able to attend the annual
meeting and would like to help the Campaign, we would like your proxy
assigned to us so that others can attend. You can contact us at (718)
852-2808 or <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:+stopkillercoke@aol.com" target="_blank" >
stopkillercoke@aol.com</a> and we will explain how to transfer your proxy.
If proxyholders plan to attend the shareholders&#39; meeting and would like to
join protest activities, please contact us.
</p><p>On this year's agenda is a shareholders' resolution submitted by
William C. Wardlaw III, owner of 15,205 shares of Common Stock. The
Company
filed legal papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission in an
effort
to prevent Mr. Wardlaw's resolution from appearing on this year's proxy
statement. The SEC disagreed with Coca-Cola's rationale. Of course, now
that it's on the proxy statement, Coca-Cola has asked shareholders not to
support the proposal.
</p><p><b>"Shareowner Proposal Regarding a Board Committee on Human Rights
(Item 6) </b>
</p><p>"RESOLVED:
</p><p>"Shareholders amend the Bylaws, by adding the following new section at
the end of Article III:
</p><p><i>"Section 4 . Board Committee on Human Rights</i>. <b>There is
established a Board Committee on Human Rights, which is created and
authorized to review the implications of company policies, above and
beyond
matters of legal compliance, for the human rights of individuals in the US
and worldwide. </b>
</p><p>"The Board of Directors is authorized in its discretion consistent with
these Bylaws, the Articles of Incorporation and applicable law to (1)
select the members of the Board Committee on Human Rights, (2) provide
said
committee with funds for operating expenses, (3) adopt regulations or
guidelines to govern said Committee's operations, (4) empower said
Committee to solicit public input and to issue periodic reports to
shareholders and the public, at reasonable expense and excluding
confidential information, including but not limited to an annual report on
the implications of company policies, above and beyond matters of legal
compliance for the human rights of individuals in the US and worldwide,
and
(5) any other measures within the Board's discretion consistent with these
Bylaws and applicable law.
</p><p>Nothing herein shall restrict the power of the Board of Directors to
manage the business and affairs of the company. The Board Committee on
Human Rights shall not incur any costs to the company except as authorized
by the Board of Directors.
</p><p><b>"Supporting Statement:
</b>
</p><p>"The Coca-Cola Company, its bottlers, and suppliers have been
associated with human rights controversies, leading to:
</p><p>"* The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College
Retirement Equities Fund (TIAA-CREF) divesting the Coca-Cola Co. stock
from
and banning further investments in its $9 billion CREF Social Choice
Account, the nation's largest socially screened fund for individual
investors.
</p><p>"* A <i>USA Today</i> "cover story" includes a quote claiming that
some 45 colleges and universities removing Coke products from their
campuses as a result of alleged human rights violations by its Colombian
bottler (10/30/07).
</p><p>"* BBC News reporting that our company has been accused of
benefiting from prison labor in China (5/21/07).
</p><p>"* A May 2007 report by The International Environmental Law
Research Centre accused the company of detrimental impacts on drinking and
agricultural water supplies in India, violating human rights.
</p><p>"In the opinion of the proponents, the company's existing governance
process does not sufficiently elevate human rights issues within the
company or serve the interests of shareholders in expediting effective
solutions. The proposed Bylaw would establish a Board Committee on Human
Rights that could review and make policy recommendations regarding human
rights issues raised by the company's activities and policies.
</p><p>"In defining 'human rights,' proponents suggest that the committee
could use the US Bill of Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights as nonbinding benchmarks or reference documents."
</p><p><b>2. Coca-Cola, the China Olympics &amp; Darfur
</b>
</p><p>The Coca-Cola Co. has recently come under criticism due to its
involvement as a major sponsor of the 2008 Olympic games in China because
China supports the Sudanese government. Director Steven Spielberg quit his
post as an artistic adviser of the 2008 Olympics and Mia Farrow linked The
Coca-Cola Co. and human rights abuses in Darfur saying: "Tell Coca-Cola
you&#39;re switching to Pepsi."
Farrow says the government of Sudan, largely financed by Chinese oil money
and armed with Chinese-made weapons, has declared war on the rural,
agrarian tribal people of Darfur. According to Farrow, China buys about 70
percent of its oil from Sudan. (<i>The Capital Times</i>, 2/23/08)
</p><p>&quot;I first heard of Darfur in 2004, that there was something terrible
happening in this remote part of Africa,&quot; she said. "...2.5 million people
are refugees in the area and that probably more than 400,000 have been
killed in ethnic violence. We don&#39;t really know how many have died. The
United Nations count stopped at 200,000 because there is now no one to
count the bodies.&quot;
</p><p>According to a recent Associated Press report, the already difficult
situation in Darfur has worsened recently as the result of new fighting,
including aerial bombing and increased banditry of humanitarian aid.
</p><p><b>Coca-Cola board member Peter Ueberroth is the chair of the U.S.
Olympic Committee</b>. Despite an embargo of Sudan, Coca-Cola continues
operating there. Jeffrey Gettleman reported in <i>The New York Times
</i>(10/24/06) &quot;In 2002, Sudanese investors opened a new Coca-Cola
factory,
with Coke syrup legally exported to Sudan under an exemption for food and
medicine. The $140-million plant churns out 100,000 bottles of Coke,
Sprite
and Fanta per hour...&quot;
</p><p>In opening up the plant, The Coca-Cola Co. exploited a loophole in the
U.S. sanctions, thus propping up the Sudan economy and the government of
Sudan&#39;s President Omar al-Bashir, an army general who seized power in 1989
through a military coup. Among the biggest beneficiaries of government
revenues have been his troops in a country where the per capita income
remains pitiful low. Later, as the Darfur violence developed, Coca-Cola
has
continued to supply the plant and ignored the atrocities in Darfur.
</p><p>According to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of Treasury
Department, Coca-Cola has paid fines &quot;to settle allegations of violations
of the Sudan sanctions occurring between Jan. 2002 and April 2004...OFAC
alleged that Coca-Cola exported to its bottler in Sudan services not
authorized by its OFAC license and disregarded or evaded certain OFAC
license restrictions. The services included financial and market support.&quot;
</p><p>Warren Buffett -- who left Coca-Cola&#39;s board in 2006, but remains
the company&#39;s largest shareholder with about 8.7% of common shares
outstanding, worth nearly $12 billion -- is also a major investor in
the PetroChina Oil Company which gets oil from Sudan and has been targeted
by the Sudan divestment community. &quot;Oil has turned it [Sudan] into one of
the fastest-growing economies in Africa &amp;3151; if not the world --
emboldening the nation&#39;s already belligerent government and giving it the
wherewithal to resist the Western demands to end the conflict in Darfur,&quot;
<i>The New York Times </i>has reported.
</p><p>Another issue linking Coke to China's abuses was exposed in a BBC
report that China used prison labor to work on Coca-Cola merchandise: "Jon
Sims says he was imprisoned in Zhejiang province in 2006, because of a
financial dispute over the divorce settlement with his Chinese wife. It
was
in Ningbo prison, he told the BBC, that he was made to work on merchandise
intended for the company."

Jenkins, February 22, 2008 </b>

<br>&quot;But American corporate executives will find it less easy to cop
[International Olympic Committee President Jacques] Rogge&#39;s plea of
ineffectuality, and they certainly can&#39;t plead that they are &#39;apolitical.&#39;
Seven of the top 12 Beijing Games sponsors are American, and they have
poured money into the event in return for Olympic-sized access to the
Chinese market. You should know who they are: Visa, Kodak, Johnson &amp;
Johnson, McDonald&#39;s [one of Coke's largest customers], General Electric,
John Hancock and <b>Coca-Cola</b>.&quot;

Budweiser and UPS.

<br>" Film director Steven Spielberg and actress Mia Farrow joined
activists worldwide Tuesday in using the Olympics as a backdrop to address
human rights concerns, urging Beijing to exert political leverage on
Sudan&#39;s government to help end the crisis in Darfur. Spielberg announced
he
would no longer act as an artistic adviser for the opening and closing
ceremonies, saying he could not reconcile working on the Olympics while
China and other nations were not doing enough to ease the suffering."

</p><p><b>3. Wardlaw Submitted China/Human Rights Proposals for 3 Consecutive
Years</b>
</p><p>In 2004, looking ahead, B. Wardlaw, a human rights advocate and
philanthropist who supports the Task Force for Homeless in Atlanta,
submitted a shareholder resolution for the third consecutive year
regarding
Coke's involvement with China and his desire to see Coke use its influence
to move China toward a more humane labor and human rights policy.
</p><center>
<p><b>"CHINA BUSINESS PRINCIPLES FOR RIGHTS OF WORKERS IN
CHINA</b></p></center>
<p>"WHEREAS: our company&#39;s business practices in China respect human and
labor rights of workers. The eleven principles below were designed to
commit a company to a widely accepted and thorough set of human and labor
rights standards for China. They were defined by the International Labor
Organization and the United Nations Covenants on Economic, Social &amp;
Cultural Rights, and Civil &amp; Political Rights. They have been signed by
the
C
government and China&#39;s national laws.
</p><p>"(1) No goods or products produced within our company&#39;s facilities or
those of suppliers shall be manufactured by bonded labor, forced labor,
within prison camps or as part of reform-through-labor or
reeducation-through-labor programs.
</p><p>"(2) Our facilities and suppliers shall adhere to wages that meet
workers&#39; basic needs, fair and decent working hours, and at a minimum, to
the wage and hour guidelines provided by China&#39;s national labor laws.
</p><p>"(3) Our facilities and suppliers shall prohibit the use of corporal
punishment, any physical, sexual or verbal abuse or harassment of workers.
</p><p>"(4) Our facilities and suppliers shall use production methods that do
not negatively affect the worker&#39;s occupational safety and health.
</p><p>"(5) Our facilities and suppliers shall not call on police or military
to enter their premises to prevent workers from exercising their rights.
</p><p>"(6) We shall undertake to promote the following freedoms among our
employees and the employees of our suppliers: freedom of association and
assembly, including the rights to form unions and bargain collectively;
freedom of _expression_, and freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention.
</p><p>"(7) Company employees and those of our suppliers shall not face
discrimination in hiring, remuneration or promotion based on age, gender,
marital status, pregnancy, ethnicity, region of origin, labor, political
or
religious activity, or on involvement in demonstrations, past records of
arrests or internal exile for peaceful protest, or membership in
organizations committed to non-violent social or political change.
</p><p>"(8) Our facilities and suppliers shall use environmentally responsible
methods of production that have minimum adverse impact on land, air and
water quality.
</p><p>"(9) Our facilities and suppliers shall prohibit child labor, at a
minimum comply with guidelines on minimum age for employment within
China&#39;s
national labor laws.
</p><p>"(10) We will not sell or provide products or technology in China that
can be used to commit human rights violations or labor rights abuse.
</p><p>"(11) We will issue annual statements to the China Working Group
detailing our
efforts to uphold these principles and to promote these basic freedoms.
</p><p>"RESOLVED: Stockholders request the Board of Directors to make all
possible lawful efforts to implement and/or increase activity on each of
the principles named above in the People&#39;s Republic of China.
</p><p>"SUPPORTING STATEMENT: As U.S. companies import more goods, consumer
and shareholder concern is growing about working conditions in China that
fall below basic standards of fair and humane treatment.
</p><p>"We hope that our company can prove to be a leader in its industry and
embrace these principles."
</p><p>For the third consecutive shareholders' meeting, in 2004, Mr. Wardlaw
stated: "I introduced this proposal because I, along with many other
socially conscious shareholders, are concerned about Coke, its reputation
and its share price. As I&#39;ve said here the last two years, we seem to be
heading toward a possible public relations calamity in China...We&#39;re
spending
over $1 billion over the last 20 years in China developing products there.
The Olympics are coming to China in 2008 in Beijing. This is a moment
where
Coca-Cola is going to be highlighted because of our close involvement with
the Olympics and as a recognized product in the world. I think we are
still
not paying enough attention to what could happen in China. Every human
rights abuse possible has been committed in China...&quot;
</p><p><b>The Coca-Cola Co. shareholders voted against Mr. Wardlaw's
resolution for the third consecutive year.</b>

</p><p><b>1. Mark Thomas on Coke</b>
<br>A 48 minute documentary, &quot;Dispatches: Mark Thomas on Coca-Cola,&quot; was
produced in England by Mark Thomas, a well-known social critic and
investigative journalist and film producer-director Sarah MacDonald. Ms.
MacDonald is the recipient of British Academy of Film &amp; Television Awards
(BAFTA).
</p><p>The film was broadcast nationally during prime time on Channel 4 in
England on November 19, 2007. The film highlights Coke&#39;s human rights and
environmental abuses in Colombia and India, as well as Coke&#39;s ugly history
of racial discrimination and collaboration with the Nazis during World War
II. The footage taken in El Salvador shows child laborers cutting sugar
cane in the fields and shows trucks taking the cane from the fields to
Coke&#39;s sugar supplier. There are interviews with Salvadoran political
leaders very critical of Coke regarding child labor and environmental
abuses. And there&#39;s more...
</p><p><b>2. The Cost of a Coke</b>
<br>Matt Beard, a student at the University of Montana, created a
20-minute film released in Nov. 2007 entitled, &quot;The Cost of a Coke.&quot; Matt
uses graphics and video to highlight Coke&#39;s abuses, how Judge Jose
Martinez
was shown to be in conflicts of interest as he deals with the Coca-Cola
Alien Tort Claims lawsuits in Miami and how the ILO (International Labor
Organization) &quot;investigation&quot; turned out to be a scam.
</p><p><b>3. WB11 News Feature</b>
<br>Coca-Cola Faces Human Rights Violations is a 6-minute special news
feature televised on New York City's WB11 in 2005. It features college and
university efforts to hold Coke accountable and hard-hitting statements by
New York City Council Member Hiram Monserrate detailing what his
fact-finding mission to Colombia uncovered.

</p><p><b>Drink of the Death Squads</b>
<br>By David Rovics, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.davidrovics.com/" target="_blank" >www.davidrovics.com</a>
</p><p>Coke came to Colombia
<br>Seeking lower wages
<br>They got just what they came for
<br>But as we turn the pages
<br>We find the workers didn&#39;t like the sound
<br>Of their children&#39;s hungry cries
<br>So they said we&#39;ll join the union
<br>And they began to organize
</p><p>So Coke called up a terrorist group
<br>Called the AUC
<br>They said &quot;we&#39;ve got some problems
<br>At the factory&quot;
<br>So these thugs went to the plant
<br>Killed two union men
<br>Told the rest, &quot;you leave the union
<br>Or we&#39;ll be back again&quot;
</p><p>Now Coke did not complain
<br>About this dirty deed
<br>Why give workers higher wages
<br>When Coke is all they really need
<br>They phoned the AUC
<br>Said &quot;thanks, without you we&#39;d go broke
<br>And to show our appreciation
<br>Here&#39;s one hundred cases of Coke&quot;
</p><p> (Chorus)
<br>The baby drinks it in his bottle
<br>When the water ain&#39;t no good
<br>The dog drinks it
<br>But he don&#39;t know if he should
<br>Some folks say
<br>It&#39;s the nectar of the Gods
<br>But Coke is the drink of the Death Squads
</p><p>Well the workers wouldn&#39;t take
<br>This situation lying down
<br>Some went up to Georgia
<br>Said &quot;look what&#39;s happened to our town
<br>You American workers got downsized
<br>And as for us we just get shot
<br>And those of us who survive
<br>Our teeth begin to rot&quot;
</p><p>(Chorus)
</p><p>Well now that&#39;s the situation
<br>What are you gonna do
<br>&#39;Cause death squads run Colombia
<br>And they&#39;re paid by me and you
<br>We can let Coke run the world
<br>And see what future that will bring
<br>Or we can drink juice and smash the state
<br>Now that&#39;s the real thing
</p><p>(Chorus)
