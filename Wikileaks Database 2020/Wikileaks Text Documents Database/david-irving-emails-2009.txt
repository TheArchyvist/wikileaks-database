Anti-Fascist Hackers Destroy Holocaust Denier David Irving's Website and Release
Private Emails, Attendee Lists

Hitler-loving Holocaust-denying David Irving's speaking tour is being attacked
on the streets and on the internet as he makes his way to speak on Saturday in
New York City.  We have released private email communications, phone numbers and
addresses of Irving as well as destroy all files, backups, emails, and databases
on his website irvingbooks.com and fpp.co.uk. We also released personal
information on people who have attended the speaking tour, made book purchases,
or online donations as a warning to those who would support people like David
Irving. 

We did this to expose this Nazi-sympathizer for who he is and to shut
down/disrupt any possibility of Irving rearing his fascist head in public during
his tour. To David Irving and all aspiring white-power, anti-immigrant,
queer-bashing, racist pigs - give it up! We will fight you on the streets and on
the internet until you are swept into the dustbin of history.

Dear Cagri

Let me worry this over.  It is a security issue for us.  I have no objection to
you covering my talk - it is near Patterson in northern NJ, and you would be
getting an exclusive, but I need assurances.

What do you suggest? I  can be reached by cell phone at 305 923 6779 in the
event of difficulties. But not before 10 pm tonight, I am speaking in
Philadelphia from 7 pm.

To: jerryholmes99@comcast.net

back in Windsor, England, Thursday, November 12, 2009

Dear Jerry,

Thank you very much for that extremely generous donation and remarks about my
writing and my legal and other battles; I am quietly confident that in the long
run my views will prevail. But David does not always win against Goliath, as I
said at the time of the Lipstadt trial.

It is good to know that I have friends around the world supporting me like this.

As for me, my own worries are gradually receding, and the writing is resuming.
But work on "Churchill's War", vol. iii: "The Sundered Dream", is proceeding
dramatically well. I am also making good progress with my biography of Heinrich
Himmler. The whole fight is costing me money, energy, age, grey cells, health,
but well worth it because of the people and friends I meet en route, like you
...

Question about this Saturday in NYC
From: Allen Rouse <bigalstack@hotmail.com>
To: focalp@aol.com
Date: Thu, Nov 12, 2009 12:37 pm
Hello Mr.Irving,
My name is Allen Rouse and my wife and I will be attending your talk this
Saturday in NYC. I am part of the media group at Stormfront, I do a weekly
program on Stormfront Radio called "The Staropramen Show", Staropramen is my
username there. I would like to know if it would be possible for me to videotape
the talk on Saturday for Stormfront. Don Black, SF's proprietor has informed us
that a major overhaul is being done to the site in the coming weeks which will
include our own video hosting capabilities and it would be nice to have this
talk for this new feature. I look forward to meeting you and enjoying your
always brilliant and informative talks.
 
Yours truly,
 
Allen Rouse/Staropramen

You find a Paki corner shop with the black and yellow WESTERN UNION side

Jeff lives in Raleigh, as you know, since he is coming to our Raleigh function.
We discussed this yesterday. And yes, you were listening... I think.

The so-called "unhelpful and hostile" messages were things that need to be said.
I don't like the way you have been treating me.

You asked for more advance notice if I wanted to flounce out- I am considering
it. You were very well behaved on this whole tour up until this past week when
you have been snotty, rude, and disrespectful towards me. This is exactly the
same way you behaved last summer and the very reason I flounced out then.

I don't care if you are frustrated, angry, stressed out, tired, or whatever-
treating anybody the way you have been treating me is unacceptable. I bend over
backwards to help you out on this tour, doing jobs that last year you would have
done yourself, and not just making bookings, but also doing things like driving,
helping you secure funds to reprint books and locating second-hand books. The
only thanks I usually get are long whines about how something isn't exactly
perfect. Why would anybody in the world want to work with or even be friends
with someone who is acting the way you have been acting lately? You like to say
you treat me better than anyone else does, but the truth is, lately you have
treated me worse than anyone else ever has. It hurts my feelings, it makes me
angry and resentful, and it makes me question whether or not I should be doing
this job anymore.

Sorry to have to say that, but I'm trying to head off a major conflict. Please
start treating me with more courtesy and respect. I really am doing the best I
can in the limited time I have available to me.

I have and had no idea where your friend lives. Is this the shooter friend? You
do not always tell me your plans in detail. We can change things around. So far
your friends do not seem to me to be worth much upheaval however. You probably
think the same about mine. As for your more unhelpful and hostile messages: "Get
over it." I have been working since 6 a.m. this morning trying to catch up and

Your messages have been increasingly ill-judged this morning. I assume (a) you
are not feeling well and are taking it out on me -- okay, that's what men
friends are for; and (b) you are instinctively trying to distract from what I
see as the accumulating omissions of the last few days.

2.  If you want to quit, I can't stop you. It will not be the first time I have
been let down at the last moment, and by your own account, you have done the
same to others too. I will then fulfil my obligations without you. Advice: It
might be a good idea if you refrain from knee-jerk retorting.

3.  I am still not able to email today's (!!) Raleigh guests with a location.
Guess why.

4.  I have been able to access to car all morning. Guess why.

For the record, I think you should make it clear on the registration page that
anyone who does not fill out the required fields risks having their reservation
canceled. It makes it very difficult for me to do reliable checks when I only
have a name or partial name or a city and no street address. Phone numbers and
emails are less important because I can't usually match those to a name.
Anyway...

Fred Douglas- NO. Not paid, no address or phone number.

Raymond E Peters- MAYBE. Cannot confirm. Please phone. Misspelled name of his
own city. Ask what his interest is, how he found out, etc.

D Mark O- MAYBE. Insufficient details. Has paid. Phone, ask questions. If phone
or email is a dud, then NO.

Randall De La Vega- Probably okay. Confirmed name and address. Middle aged male,
wife is Dawn.

Rodriguez- NO. Phoned, did not register, did not give any personal details. If
phones again, blow him off. Had plenty of time to register properly and said he
would, but did not.

Alan Rogers- Probably okay. Says friend of Bobby Ammon's. Check with Bobby? If
yes, then okay.

Richard Cox- Probably okay. Phone and ask for the names of his guests.

Mr Irving:

I just watched you at the Oxford debate at
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGMv6FNXMQk with great interest in
spite of the horrible sound.  Can you find a better version to post?

You have a dynamite sound bite that you should use frequently.
Churchill, by not stopping the war when he could have done so cheaply
in 1940, caused the holocau$t.  It forced Germany into a corner.  You
should continually blame the Jews who controlled Churchill with
causing their own disaster.  Also blame the Jews for the loss of your
empire and the immigration invasion caused by it.  As Reichminister
Goebbles, of Blessed Memory, loved to say, "The Jews are to blame.".

Richmond - 8 Nov 09
From: William 'Chip' Lamb <chip@newvoiceoldcars.com>
To: Focalp@aol.com
Date: Wed, Oct 28, 2009 8:59 pm
David, 
 
The venue for Richmond is exactly the same as last year. I just had lunch with
my father out that way and stopped by the restaurant to sign the deposit. 
 
Manakin Grille 
12912 Plaza Drive 
Richmond, VA 23233 
804-784-0544 
 
The venue is reserved under my name (Chip Lamb), my phone number and wonderfully
disguised (Julie's idea, without even being asked) as a book signing, not yours
or some group so just in case some nasty is poking around they will come up with
nothing. Hopefully as last year we will have no trouble. The owners (Darren &
Julie Witten) and their staff are the same as last year and they remembered you
and how good the event was last year; our waiter even asked after you & your
well being. This waiter remembered exactly what tables he used and where they
were placed, so the layout of the room will be the same as well. You are clear
to come in and set up as early as 5PM and we are welcome to stay past their
closing time of 9PM as needed. 
 
See if you can word it a certain way to those planning to attend that it would
be nice not to "lose" money for such a nice, supportive and discreet locale and
that they should have a steak and a glass of wine or two rather than a small
sandwich and a glass of water... perhaps you have other ideas along these lines
based on your experience in these events. We continue to learn and improve! 
 
So you are in Raleigh the evening prior, will you come up here Sat PM and spend
the night with us? It is under 3 hrs to our house, no problem if you come in
late, I make that trip all the time coming back from car auctions. 
 
I am off to Hilton Head SC tomorrow through Sunday for a Concours d'Elegance and
a couple meetings, expect I'll be back no later than mid-day Monday, still
hopeful for Sunday night. This e-mail address goes to my Blackberry as does the
phone beneath, call or e-mail as needed.

Hi Roy

I believe the good Bishop knows well the "hound" technique of these
blood-seeking sharks.  I'll also send this on to our heroic lawyer here in
London in case he can come up with one of his perspicacious suggestions.

Meantime I am devastated to hear of Attorney Jûrgen Rieger's stroke and dreadful
rumours that already he may be brain dead. If so, Germany will have lost a
formidable champion and we will have lost a splendid comrade. I am hoping and
hoping and anxiously awaiting news that this is not going to or have already
happened and that we still have him at our side.  I have only two precious
little filmed interviews from him for my forthcoming JAILING THE LAWYERS but I
always meant to get in another one (but each time I tried to, it proved not the
right moment for him, an attorney- soldier always very heavily work-overloaded
and ever at many a humane frontline).

Best wishes
Michèle

be shown in another country does not fill the requirements of §130 in any way
(even if it could be viewed in Germanistan). As I recall, he filmed the
interview with Swedish TV to be shown there and not in Germany.
> Judicia is the whore of politics and such a "Strafbefehl" should never have
been issued; it constitutes "REchtsbeugung", bending the law. §130 is a
so-called "rubber law" anyway, which the criminal Jew-owned politicians like to
have stretched to serve any purpose. To imply that statements on the holyhoax
would "incite the German people" are patently absurd. It is however blatent
proof that the BRD is a Zionist-controlled entity. It does in fact constitute
CENSORSHIP (by other means) which is unconstitutional, even in Zionist
GErmanistan.

RE: last night at Ritz Carlto9n
From: john <john@tipofthespear.tv>
To: Focalp@aol.com

I respect your wishes.  You are certainly free to choose who can or can't attend
your events.  However, I regret that you are holding me responsible for last
evening's incident. 

I have not associated myself with anyone that illegally carries weapons, uses
weapons, or engages in violence as a solution to a problem.  If they were
invited by someone in my party then they may have been invited through an
indirect relationship, and if that is the case then sincerely I apologize to
you, to everyone in attendance, and the community as a whole. 

My sources within law enforcement tell me that the husband or boyfriend of the
woman that was going to sell books for you brought several knives and a firearm
that he dumped out of his pocket while running away from the authorities. I have
seen the security tape that clearly shows the gentleman using the knife in an
aggressive and not defensive manner.  In addition, I have inspected the damage
done to the Ritz Carlton, and the damage can be undone by carpet cleaning.  If
there was some other damage that I am not aware of then the staff did not point
it out. 

I think some self examination on your part is warranted, but you can't ask
yourself not to attend future events.  It seems the questionable association was
a Trojan Horse within your own house.   

If I had not walked out into the hallway when I did and removed the knife from
the young man's hand then someone may have been killed.  The weapon could have
been used against the young man if it came into the possession of a less
responsible individual.  This was the extent of my involvement and I have never
seen any of those people that were involved prior to that evening. 

My expertise lies in the area of security, prevention, and protection.   It may
be wise for you to have a metal detector at future speaking engagements and
provide security for your own interest.  Although I am a strong supporter of
your work my attendance was meant to prevent or contain any such incident from
happening.  I am happy that my actions may have prevented the death of a person. 

As a self proclaimed author and speaker that documents “true or real” events in
history it would make sense that you would approach this incident in the same
manner as you have approached your historical accounts of World War II.  It is
clear that you have not taken such steps.  You have not gathered the evidence or
conducted any interviews like you have done while tackling your past and current
works of history.  Instead, it seems you have implemented the tactics of your
opponents and have directed them against me.  I am saddened by your choice, but
as I stated before I respect your wishes and continue to support and admire your
work. 

I wish you success in all your future endeavors, and thank you for giving this
community the opportunity to hear the truth.

Sincerely,

JB

Dear John

I am sorry to inform you that we cannot allow your attendance at my future
events. Among your guests, it appears, were some who caused a serious affray and
damage to hotel property. Their appearance caused us immediate problems with the
hotel management, as you must have appreciated, and they will not allow us to
rent their fine facilities again. The press have been phoning me and I have had
to express my deep sense of shame about what happened. We take great care to vet
our guests to avoid problems, and I feel I have been badly let down last night.

13 November Speech in North Jersey
From: FELDPOST@aol.com
To: Focalp@aol.com
Date: Tue, Nov 10, 2009 11:06 pm
Mr. Irving,

Thank you for your response. Depending upon where your speech will be, I am
hoping to travel there from Union, New Jersey. I am rather interested in the
ULTRA and MAGIC decrypts, especially since the unit that I have been writing
about - Sturmstaffel 1 - is mentioned in several of the messages, two of which I
have been able to obtain from the PRO.

At present, I am very interested in speaking with you about General der Flieger
Ulrich Kessler whose Soldbuch I recently acquired from his interrogator. Through
your book GOERING, I saw that you had contact with Kessler's son, Hans-Joachim
Kessler, and was hoping to obtain his contact information from you. I am having
dinner in Union, NJ, with two old friends on Friday, but was hoping that I might
be able to meet with you briefly after the speech. If necessary, I will gladly
pay your fee for attendance even though I would not be able to arrive in time
for your speech.

I will look forward to hearing from you as your time permits.

Regards,

Barry

P.S. Incidentally, we met in Baltimore, MD, and Monroeville, PA, at the MAX
Shows.

I think he has a hangover and is reluctant to get out of bed. Charming.

Kevin now emails: “Maybe call them and see if Western Union can tell you where I
can go where system is working ? I have lots of things to do and just don't have
more time to give this and would prefer not to be involved.”

10:21 a.m I reply:

Kevin, we are 450 dollars out of pocket; because we paid fifty bucks extra for
instantaneous transfer yesterday, instead of five dollars for overnight. I
cannot phone the UK from USA, my phone service does not permit international
calls. There is a Western Union office in Conduit Street near the Park Lane end,
south side. They never let us down.

This is one of those days. Jae now replies:

1) No, I really am quite displeased with your recent behaviour. Perhaps you are
not aware of the way you have been coming across, in which case, I am bringing
it to your attention.
2) If you do not want to be let down, then stop letting me down.
3) I have just resent the location to you. The email I sent earlier bounced back
to me as undeliverable. Did you receive it this time?
4) Why did you not knock on my door and ask for the keys? I am only right next
door in 410.

She will have a very tough time  in life if she leaps onto her high horse every
time she is corrected by her elders and betters.

Jae forwards this: “Did he send this to you also?

"Problems?? I've been to 4 places and all say system down?? I've no more time to
waste on this so if you can locate one that is working and called them to make
sure then I will go?? Otherwise the recipient can send someone to collect"

I assume he is talking about Western Union, but not sure why he sent it to me,
unless by mistake.

10:35 a.m: “Jessica just phoned me again. Bente is not permitted to take her
morphine and medications on an empty stomach. Jessica says there is a W U office
on Sloane Street. I have sent her out to ascertain that their system is not
down. She will get back to me in a few minutes and I will tell you. Hey ho. I am
five thousand miles away at present, and about to depart on yet another
three-hour drive.”

Jae has found a Washington DC restaurant. I congratulate her: “(conditional)
well done!”

10:41 a.m: “Jessica went to Western Union website, established that there is an
office in the Knightsbridge underground station, and phoned them, and they
confirm they are open for business with all systems up today. That is on the
corner of Sloane Street. ... I hope this solves the problem!”

Irving (Texas)

6:10 pm arrived at the Dallas location, a good Best Western; several people had
telephoned from en route asking for the location , and we had a good crowd and,
Jae calculates – kneeling ... on the floor in the suite, as per the custom of
all (or at least most of) my former assistants over the years - the cash take at
about $2,200 including two good donations from Greg Gant and Drew Campbell. We
are both semi-exhausted after yet another long day, and ... She is a great
assistant in every way.

Irving – Houston (Texas)

Up at 9:40 a.m. after a long night. 10:32 a.m I send out, very late, the
notification for tonight's location. We omit Ira Bleiweiss and Mary Lee Webeck
after Jae works her magic on them. Her MAGIC machine reveals that Ira Bleiweiss
is a pro-Israeli activist; while Webeck is Director of Education at the
Holocaust Museum in Houston. Bleiweiss has given us a fictitious name, Ira Wise,
and a false phone number, and Webeck too is a hostile. They get directions to
the LaQuinta at Hobby airport in Houston instead, last year's location, twenty
or thirty miles away.

On the road to Houston by 1:30 pm.

Statement from Mayor Johnson of Jackson, Mississippi about David Irving:
"Neither the City of Jackson nor I am hosting the David Irving event at City
Hall. I will not be at this event, and I have not communicated at all with David
Irving. In fact, I do not support or endorse the claims made by David Irving. It
is my understanding that City Hall Council Chambers was reserved through the
City Clerk's office, which has purview over scheduling that venue.

"Based on the counsel of the City Legal Department, the City of Jackson cannot
legally ban someone from speaking in City Hall based on their political beliefs
and/or the content of their speech."

We arrive in Houston at six p.m. with just enough time to set up, which Jae does
alone and well. The room rapidly fills until only four chairs are left empty –
those which would normally have been filled by Bleiweiss and his guests and
Webeck. At 6:50 p.m. Ms. Webeck shortly phones (from 512 632 4137), sweetly
enough: “I am at LaQuinta at the airport, but can't find the meeting.' “Ah, then
you are there ... and we are here,” I say evenly, and add: “You probably know
why we have not give you the actual location.” A few minutes later, at 6:53
p.m., Bleiweiss phones (from 713 898 3102) for the same reason: I give him the
same answer, and add: “You will find a nice female there from the Holocaust
Museum, and you may wish to have an enjoyable evening chatting with her.” Oh,
bother, he no doubt says, or words in Hebrew to that effect; but I have already
hung up. Seconds later he phones again, furious: “We are coming over to where
you are now,” he snarls. How can he know the real location? A journalist then
phones, but I fob her off until later tonight.

I doubt he is keen to hear my talk, but nonetheless I go into the foyer and
remove all signs relating to the meeting, and try to convey to the large,
overweight Black seated alone at the reception desk that he is not to assist any
angry-looking wrong-‘uns who come in asking where we are. It proves difficult to
make him understand.


Sunday, October 19, 2009
Houston (Texas) - Covington (Louisiana)


Up at 8 a.m., a quick breakfast, two or three hours' work then downtown for an
interview at 11:30 a.m. with Page – of The Houston Chronicle at Don Diego's café
in Travis Street.

She is a pleasant, tanned woman of 46, with a prepared list of questions,
inevitable, predictable, inflexible: Holocaust, racism, etc. She turns out to
have accompanied the troublemakers (including, she says, a Black activist) at
their invitation to the La Quinta at Hobby airport last night, from where she
phoned me. So it is just as well that I did not invite her straight round to the
meeting to attend last night, as my instinct had at first suggested.

I apologise for her inconvenience, but explain that it was their purpose to stop
me speaking to “sixty or seventy consenting adults” who wished to hear my views.
Toward the end of the interview she becomes fascinated with the “blonde
bombshell” sitting at my right, who as usual consistently but sometimes even
helpfully puts her oar in to our interview. I emphasise, ..., that there is
nothing going on between us.

A couple of drifters come over to our little huddle in the Houston market
square; the first a White, or rather gray-looking, meth addict, who shuffles
over, crumpled and pathetic and incurable, and gets five dollars from me to go
away so that our interview can continue; the second a few minutes later is a
thin young Black girl, Sonia, who turns out to be thirty-one, born in Chicago:
she never knew her mother or father, her brother and sister are somewhere she
knows not where, her grandmother abused her, and she finally quit doing
marijuana and crack four months ago. “I am clean,” she says. She wants cash to
go over the road ahead to a Subway – she nods in that direction -- and when I
give her five bucks too she asks innocently can I add 41 cents as she wants to
get a “foot-long”, whatever that is.
Because of four drug-related felonies, including a “supplying” charge, she
cannot get work anywhere, of course, so it is a hopeless cycle for her. I tell
her that the prison I was in was full of people with the same problem, and a
beam of recognition of an unlikely fellow-felon spreads across her face. “Dere
ain't nothing to be 'shamed of,” she says. “Everybody goes to prison at some
time” - a sad reflection of her own colored world view.
She sleeps under “dat bridge over dere,” she says, pointing backwards without
turning round, to where the police a few days ago trashed all her few
possessions. She has bummed a coarse-knit pullover off somebody, its arms
several inches too long.
There is something about her that leaves me, a born sceptic accustomed to the
wily Romanian gypsy beggars of London's West End, mildly suspicious – her
clothes are rather clean for somebody sleeping rough; her teeth are polished and
perfect, though one at the back is missing; and her English is very articulate
and her vocabulary well organised. At one point she says “I have to fend them
off,” an unusually well chosen phrase for a Black. She has nearly completed
college when the drug disaster hit, she explains.
Jae finds her convincing. On an impulse I empty my pockets of cash and hand all
the crumpled notes to Sonia without opening them, around thirty-five or forty
dollars – all that Jae allows me to carry around. Page the Chronicle journalist
makes no effort to follow suit, and before the Black goes I lever myself to my
feet off the stone bench where we are all sitting and give this pathetic but
friendly human being a hug. “If you ever need any help,” I tell her,
mischievously indicating the journalist, “phone the Chronicle and ask for Page.”

A long drive over to New Orleans in heavy traffic along the narrow I-10
interstate highway follows, lasting six or seven hours, and it is nine p.m.
before we get into the hotel, a brand new one which Jae has found, and which
opened only two weeks ago. The rooms are very pleasant but as usual Jae turns
the suite's heating system to below ice-cold.

Larry Dicks [larry_m_d@hotmail.com] has written:

I enjoyed your Houston lecture very much and was glad to see that you were well,
especially because you have been through quite a bit since I saw you in Idaho
some four years ago. I have been a fan for years, but I found particular
interest in last night's talk due to the fact that I have just embarked on a new
career in Military Intelligence. I find myself referencing WW2 with each new
concept I learn in training, resulting in [I believe] a better understanding of
the material than my peers who do not study history. For this knowledge of WW2,
I thank you. Your books are quite compelling and have been my favorites.

Your lovely assistant mentioned that she will send a copy of your web-archives
on disk, just as you agreed to do for another gentlemen in attendance last
night. I thank you (both) very much.

Your tour of Rastenburg looks as if it is a one of a kind event. I do hope that
things go well enough in order for you to have a second one; I will be unable to
go to this one, as I will still be in training. Perhaps I can follow your trip
online.

Sorry I am going to miss this visit. I will send  a donation to Key West to help
with expenses. 
 
Two questions:
 
1.If I could arrange it, would you be interested in speaking at the US Air Force
top professional military officers school the Air War College located here in
Montgomery at Maxwell AFB on some future visits? The college has about 300
colonels/ lieutenant colonels in attendance. I was a senior faculty member at
the College when I retired.
 
2. What did you think of Pat Buchanan's book "Churchill, Hitler, and the
Unnecessary War"?
 
Respectfully,
 
Col. Thomas W. McGuire Jr.
209 Arrowhead Dr
Montgomery, AL 36117

Dear Mr. Irving I have been waiting a long time to see you speak live, I have
read The path to war, Hitler's war, Goering and I am reading The trail of the
fox. Although I am not a historian you are clearly the model to follow.

Was so grateful to get the card. Last time I contacted, must have given my
address. It is a homeless shelter and had hoped to be in better situation by
this time.
 
If you like having gap-toothed homeless people who can't afford to pay, will be
happy to oblige. Can possibly bring one younger, more voluble & able to pay.
 
I did give you fifty dollars once and still feel it's the best investment in
terms of getting truthful revision.
 
In any case will keep the card and surely by next year or so will manage to meet
you.
 
Best in your New York Appearance,


11.11.09 That's nice of you and will try to come with one legit. attendee if
possible. (Think am getting near the end of these severe money restrictions
soon, so am optimistic about attending in the future.)
 
Here's my Yahoo Messenger Phone-in in case you want to leave message fast:

It is with the deepest regrets that I say I cannot attend your even in NYC this
weekend. My presence is expected at a wedding on the same evening. This has
caused me immense distress. So you won't be meeting the crazy guy sending all
the emails.
 
Keep the $15 -- I have gotten more than my money's worth reading your wonderful
website and enjoying the free downloads (I will add however that I ended up
purchasing each book I first read in free download form--multiple copies,
especially of Hitler's War, which I have read so many times it keeps falling
apart.)
 
I am hoping you will be back in NY soon and that none of my relatives will be
getting married at the same time.
 
This is the same goddamn thing that always happens to me. I have never yet in my
life had the chance to grasp the fleeting fickle Goddess of Fortune when she
flies by.
 
I mentioned in an earlier email that my paternal grandfather's brother fought on
the German side during WWII. I know he was stationed on the Eastern front and
though he lived for years after the war was a very sick man from his
incarceration in Russia, and died relatively young. I'd be honored if you could
ID his uniform (I will scan and email it). I believe he was a common foot
soldier in the Wehrmacht, but he could have been SS for all I know.
 
Please keep me on your mailing list, Mr. Irving. I look forward to meeting you
one day.
 
Sincerely,
Ed Lieber

I attended your Miami talk in May 2005. My great-grandfather was a member of the
German Intelligence Services overseas during WWII, and my grandfather was a
member of the Waffen-SS. Currently I'm a college student, and my goal is to
obtain a PhD in History, and another PhD in Philosophy. Needless to say, I
GREATLY admire your work.

Hello Mr. Irving,
I have paid for two seats at your talk next weekend in NYC. My question is when
the information is sent will it be necessary for me to print something out? I
don't have a printer and I want to avoid having to run to the library at the
last minute to try and get something printed out.
 
Thank you and looking forward to seeing you,
 
Allen Rouse. 


Hello Mr.Irving,
My name is Allen Rouse and my wife and I will be attending your talk this
Saturday in NYC. I am part of the media group at Stormfront, I do a weekly
program on Stormfront Radio called "The Staropramen Show", Staropramen is my
username there. I would like to know if it would be possible for me to videotape
the talk on Saturday for Stormfront. Don Black, SF's proprietor has informed us
that a major overhaul is being done to the site in the coming weeks which will
include our own video hosting capabilities and it would be nice to have this
talk for this new feature. I look forward to meeting you and enjoying your
always brilliant and informative talks.
 
Yours truly,
 
Staropramen

Hello David,
  How are you doing? So glad to see you are free & back giving speeches.. I'm
very much looking forward to seeing you Nov 13th in Northern NJ... I have
already signed up at irvingbooks.com/functions and paid for a ticket.. The
only thing is my girlfriend decided she wanted to come w/ me..So I went back
to the site and again put that I'm one person looking to make a
registration..I'm not at all concerned about saving a couple dollars for the 2
person fee. But I want to make sure that I am marked down for two people that
night...

2 People Intending Nov 13-Northern NJ... Kevin Hasbrouck & Mayrette Rosario.

Sincerely

P.S. I wrote to you a couple times in the past & even when you were in Prison
you wrote back to me and were so gracious.. Thank you.

Can you tell me when and where you will be speaking in North Jersey on 13
November? I will be in Union, NJ, that evening and may be able to attend.

Mr. Irving,

Thank you for your response. Depending upon where your speech will be, I am
hoping to travel there from Union, New Jersey. I am rather interested in the
ULTRA and MAGIC decrypts, especially since the unit that I have been writing
about - Sturmstaffel 1 - is mentioned in several of the messages, two of which I
have been able to obtain from the PRO.
     At present, I am very interested in speaking with you about General der
Flieger Ulrich Kessler whose Soldbuch I recently acquired from his
interrogator. Through your book GOERING, I saw that you had contact with
Kessler's son, Hans-Joachim Kessler, and was hoping to obtain his contact
information from you. I am having dinner in Union, NJ, with two old friends
on Friday, but was hoping that I might be able to meet with you briefly
after the speech. If necessary, I will gladly pay your fee for attendance
even though I would not be able to arrive in time for your speech.

I will look forward to hearing from you as your time permits.

Regards,

Barry

P.S. Incidentally, we met in Baltimore, MD, and Monroeville, PA, at the MAX
Shows.

I live in NJ (obviously).  Was wondering where you were going to be speaking in
nj.  Was also curious if you still had any copies of "the last battle" left.  I
had emailed long ago when you still had it but i never ordered it.  Hope to hear
from you.

SEEMS OVER EAGER: I am looking forward to your lecture. I need to know generally
where you will be speaking for your New Jersey date. I work in south jersey and
need to let my boss know soon if I will need to be on site for half a day that
day so I can arrive at the lecture at 7. Depending on the town where your
lecture is taking place, I may also need to take public transportation, which is
not so good, or I might be able to borrow a friend's car. 
Thanks,
Jon
Hello,

I need to let my boss know at least a week in advance if I will be using sick
time to take off for 13 Nov. I also might wish to switch my reservation to the
Philadelphia lecture if your event is in North New Jersey, should I do that?  I
know of your need to keep the lecture location a private matter until a closer
time but I need to make arrangements for work and transportation so please let
me know what I should do. 
Thanks,
Jon

Mr Irving,

The animated image on your website says you're passing through Philadelphia on
November 12, but this city/date does not show up on the registration form. Are
you actually coming to Philadelphia? If so, my wife, Dawn, and I would be
interested in hearing you speak there.

If not, we would like to register for the event in New Jersey on November 13.
This could be a bit of a drive for us, especially during rush hour. Do you
already have a city selected? What time do you typically get started?

Thanks in advance.


we are still working on a Philly location Scott but will keep you informed.
