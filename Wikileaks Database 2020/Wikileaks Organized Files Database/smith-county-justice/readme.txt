This archive contains an electronic (pdf) edition of the suppressed book "Smith County Justice" by David Ellsworth. This book, which exposes corruption in the criminal legal system of Smith County, Texas, USA, was withdrawn by the publisher and removed from all bookstores shortly after publication due to pressure from the authorities exposed in the book. Since then, there has been a concerted effort to suppress this story. It is hoped that the availablity of this electronic edition will make that suppression more difficult.
