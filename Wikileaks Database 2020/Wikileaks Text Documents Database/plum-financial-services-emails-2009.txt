yes, only foster's not much for his but I've got notionals and salaries from empmails to load (which are getting old). Once I've done them then I'm happy to go home or if I can be bothered I have a PLS I need to finish testing and some auality checking of Stuart & Michael and maybe Sammi's (just so that I can put some coaching reports or negative quality) and some CI calcs I want to finish off.
I guess I'll just see how I go with wasting a lovely Sunday at work

to be honest I haven't checked a lot of his work lately, this is the first salary file for awhile so I'm not to sure, he has improved over the last couple of months but I still think in a lot of cases he goes for the quick solution

as for that other thing she is the dumbest f'kn c**t - if she scratches one more time whilst talking to me I'm going to throw my new fan at her. I offered to help her with a prepayment calc after 5 on Friday because I thought it would be easy and save Mark on Monday - so I had a look at the calc sheet an the dates were different on the sheet from the kit paperwork, she was running a quote at different date, the spreadsheet then didn't have all the testing info like greater off benefits, to me she is just wasting my time and everyone else's because she/it has no idea
the whole time she just sat there scratching her hands

Why was she running a quote at a different date?? How on earth did she expect to get the same figures as superb doing that?? What did you say to her? Make sure to tell mark! I want the dumb scrag gone straight after Jamie....

her answer was oh yeah yeah I meant to run quote at same date. I've been putting coaching reports on the quality database because that's the only way Mark and Jackie can start to do anything. don't worry my last couple of reports are writing in the same way I speak, adding that I don't feel confident that Sammi understands the plan or has the knowledge.
