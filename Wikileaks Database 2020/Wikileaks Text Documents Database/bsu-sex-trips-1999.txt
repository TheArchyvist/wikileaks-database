I haveexperienced many scenarios, but there are two scenes I fantasize aboutbut have never experienced.A. I have never done a scat scene. I am searching for someone to fulfilla fantasy I have had for some time but have been unable to fulfill. Iwould love to receive a brown shower and serve as your toilet. Threeversions:1. I am bound and lying on my back and you stand or squat over me anddrop your waste on my face, forcing me to have my mouth open and catchpart of it. The rest is smeared on me, getting it all over my face, evenin my hair, while I eat what is in my mouth.2. You defecate on a plate and force me to eat your offering. I am nakedand have my hands bound behind my back so that I can only use my lipsand tongue and teeth, making the episode as messy as possible. You tryto make me "clean my plate."3. Same as No. 2, but instead I am bound and you feed me your waste witha spoon.B. Another fantasy: I have a fantasy where I am forced by whippings,spankings and slappings to become a sissy slut, with a complete makeoverand full dress in heels, hose, panties, corset, top, fake nails, makeup,jewelry, anything my mistress desires. Then I am forced to service oraccommodate a man or several men at the same time: sucking them, lickingtheir balls, kissing them, allowing them to fuck me, sucking one whileanother fucks me, and at the end having them shoot their cum all over myface and rubbing their cocks on my face, spreading their cum all overme.Can you accommodate me?
