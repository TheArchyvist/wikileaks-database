<H2>The <A NAME="purpose">purpose</A> of the Textbook</H2>

The revised edition of <EM>&quot;Pay Attention to Yourselves and to All the Flock&quot;</EM> is <BR>
presented as a practical and convenient handbook for congregation elders and <BR>
traveling overseers to use in caring for responsibilities as shepherds of the flock of <BR>
God.&#139;Acts 20:28&#59; I Pet. 5:2.<P>

As appointed elders and Christian overseers, you have been given the responsi-<BR>
bility to ensure that the flock is well fed. (Compare John 21:15-17.) Among other <BR>
things, this calls for teaching the congregation as a whole through instructive <BR>
meetings. It also involves appropriate teaching on a personal basis to enlighten, give <BR>
counsel, exhort, and reprove. Improving your ability as teachers is given special <BR>
consideration in this publication.<P>

Another important part of an overseer's work involves taking the lead in field <BR>
service. Therefore, emphasis is placed on your regular participation in the public <BR>
ministry and on how you can help others to have a meaningful share.<P>

With so many outside pressures bearing on the brothers, you are often faced <BR>
with matters involving counsel and judgment. How can you be sure that you are <BR>
viewing matters from Jehovah's standpoint? When judging cases that come to your <BR>
attention, how can you be balanced in showing loving concern for the brothers <BR>
involved while making sure that Jehovah's righteousness is upheld? This publication <BR>
gives these matters careful consideration.<P>

Material from the three original segments of <EM>&quot;Pay Attention to Yourselves and to <BR>
All the Flock, &quot;</EM> published in 1977, 1979, and 1981, has been combined and updated. <BR>
The outline presentation of the information has been retained. This facilitates <BR>
locating particular points that you may need to find quickly. Thus the book will <BR>
continue to serve as a handbook to be used in connection with elders' meetings, <BR>
judicial matters, and the periodically conducted Kingdom Ministry School.<P>

The wide margins and other blank spaces and pages have been provided so that <BR>
you can make appropriate notes for your personal use and can add references as <BR>
related information is published or otherwise brought to your attention. If it should <BR>
become necessary to make substantial revisions at a future dale, the Society will <BR>
issue revised information on individual pages that can be conveniently inserted, <BR>
thus keeping the information in the book up-to-date.<P>

We are confident that you greatly appreciate your privilege of serving Jehovah's <BR>
people as undershepherds of God's flock. Your life is filled with many responsibili-<BR>
ties&#59; you are also subject to many pressures. On the other hand, you receive many <BR>
blessings and much joy. May you find the information in this handbook to be <BR>
helpful in caring for your assigned duties. And may your faithful service continue <BR>
to bring refreshment and strength to the flock of God, your brothers.&#139;Isa. 32:2.</font><P><font size=+1>
