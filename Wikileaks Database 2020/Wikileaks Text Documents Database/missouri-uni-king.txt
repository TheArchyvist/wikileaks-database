According to the LNU's Code of Conduct, King(Qing Lin),the third year student,is on one year's probation starting from 23rd of May,2007.This punishment was issued today by the Students' Affairs Office of LNU which took about a week for the processing It was given according to King's cheating in his assignment works, disturbing to the order of regular teaching and management, and his verbal threat towards the administrator.One year probation is the second serious punishment,the first one is the dismissal.
King's behavior will be evaluated during the year, according to which,the release or further punishment will be issued to him.
King has accepted the punishment, but asked to keep the punishment from posting to the public.We should respect his request since he and his parents have promised that he would not break the regulation again in the future.
For your information.
