# The Wikileaks Database Backup Project
Welcome to the The Wikileaks Database Backup Project wiki, a means of archiving the files that were leaked on Wikileaks as a backup. These are downloaded to the best of my abilities using the [Wikileaks torrent file](https://file.wikileaks.org/file.torrent). The reason that I am backing this up has mainly to do with everything that has been going on in the media (as of July 07, 2020) with all the Jefferey Epistien and Ghislaine Maxwell jazz going on. I only hope to be able to be helpful with providing this simple archive.

Please note that this is a work in progress and I will continue to update as much as I can. I am only one person. The files are currently being uploaded, but the wiki pages might take longer to get up and running. In the meantime, you may go unto the [ < code >](https://github.com/TheArchyvist/wikileaks-database) tab and browse the [Wikileaks Database 2020](https://github.com/TheArchyvist/wikileaks-database/tree/master/Wikileaks%20Database%202020) directory.
