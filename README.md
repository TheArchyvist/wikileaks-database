# The Wikileaks Database Backup Project
Welcome to the The Wikileaks Database Backup Project wiki, a means of archiving the files that were leaked on Wikileaks as a backup. These are downloaded to the best of my abilities using the [Wikileaks torrent file](https://file.wikileaks.org/file.torrent). The reason that I am backing this up has mainly to do with everything that has been going on in the media (as of July 07, 2020) with all the Jefferey Epistien and Ghislaine Maxwell jazz going on. I only hope to be able to be helpful with providing this simple archive.

Please check out the [The Wikileaks Database Backup Project Wiki](https://github.com/TheArchyvist/wikileaks-database/wiki) for further information on the files.
