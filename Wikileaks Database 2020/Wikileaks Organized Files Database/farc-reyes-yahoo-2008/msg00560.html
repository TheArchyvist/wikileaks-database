DEAR FRIEND, 
COMPLIMENTS, 
I AM THE MANAGER OF BILL AND EXCHANGE AT THE FOREIGN REMITTANCE
DEPARTMENT OF BANK OF AFRICA . 
I AM WRITTING TO SEEK YOUR COPERATION OVER THIS BUSINESSDEAL.IN MY
DEPARTMENT, I DISCOVERED AN ABANDONED SUM OF $30MILLION USD(THIRTYMILLION
US DOLLARS)ONLY , IN ANACCOUNT THAT BELONGS TO ONE OF OUR FOREIGN
CUSTOMERS WHO DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY IN A PLANE CRASH THAT TOOK
PLACE IN KENYA ,EAST AFRICA ,THE LATE DR. GEORGE BRUMLEY,A CITIZEN OF
ATLANTA , UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BUT NATURALISED IN BURKINAFASO, WEST AFRICA
AND CONTRACTOR WITH ECOWAS,(ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES) 

SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING HIS
NEXT OF KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE
RELEASED UNLESS SOMEBODY APPLIES FOR IT AS NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION TO THE
DECEASED AS INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDELINES BUT UNFORTUNATELY , ALL HIS
SUPPOSED NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION DIED ALONGSIDE WITH HIM AT THE PLANE
CRASH LEAVING NOBODY BEHIND FOR THE CLAIM. IT IS THEREFORE UPON THIS
DISCOVERY THAT I NOW DECIDED TO MAKE THIS BUSINNESS PROPOSAL TO YOU AND
RELEASE THE MONEY TO YOU VIA YOUR FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNT AS THE NEXT OF
KIN OR RELATION TO THE DECEASED FOR SAFETY AND SUBSEQUENT DISBURSEMENT
SINCE NOBODY IS COMING FOR IT AND THIS MONEY COULD GO INTO THE BANK
TREASURY AS UNCLAIMED BILL. 
THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINE HERE STIPULATES THAT IF SUCH MONEY
REMAINED UNCLAIMED AFTER FIVE YEARS, THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERED INTO THE
BANK TREASURY AS UNCLAIMED FUND.THE REQUEST FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE AND
MAXIMUM CO-OPERATION AS A FOREIGN CITIZEN TO STAND AS THE NEXT OF KIN IN
THIS BUSINESS IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE DECEASED CUSTOMER WAS A
FOREIGNER AND A BURKINABE CANNOT STAND AS NEXT OF KIN TO AFOREIGNER. 
40 % OF THIS MONEY WILL BE FOR YOU AS MY FOREIGN PARTNER,INRESPECT TO
THE PROVISION OF A FOREIGN ACCOUNT. 10 %WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR EXPENCES
INCURED DURING THE BUSINESS AND 50 % WOULD BE FOR ME.THERE AFTER I WILL
COME OVER TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR DISBURSEMENT ACCODING THE PERCENTAGES
INDICATED.THEREFORE TO ENABLE THE IMMEDIATE TRNANSFER OF THIS FUND TO YOU
AS ARRANGED,YOU MUST APPLY FIRST TO THE BANK AS THE RELATION OR NEXT
OF KIN TO THE DECEASED,INDICATING YOUR CLAIMS AND WHEREIN THE MONEY
WILL BE REMITTED . 
UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR REPLY, I WILL SEND TO YOU BY FAX OR EMAIL THE TEXT
OF APPLICATION WHICH YOU WILL FILL ANDSUBMIT TO THE OFFICE OF THE
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DIRECTOR OF THE BANK OF AFRICA . I WILL NOT FAILTO BRING
TO YOUR NOTICE THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS STRICLY CONFIDENTIAL AND I WILL
USE MY POSITION IN THIS BANK TO EFFECT A HITCH FREE TRANSFER OF THE
FUND.
