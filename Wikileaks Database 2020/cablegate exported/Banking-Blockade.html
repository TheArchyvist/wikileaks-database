    <h1>Banking Blockade</h1>

    

    <p>14th July 2011, 2pm GMT:</p>

<h3 class="spip">DataCell files a complaint with the European Commission July 14th 2011</h3>
<p>	The closure by VISA Europe and MasterCard  of Datcell‘s access to the payment card networks in order to stop donations to WikiLeaks  violates the competition rules of  the European Community.</p>

<p>	Today WikiLeaks and DataCell Ltd. of Iceland  filed a complaint against the international card companies, VISA Europe and MasterCard Eurpe, for infringement of  the antitrust rules of the EU.</p>

<p>       DataCell offered payment gateway services to WikiLeaks  through  DataCell´s merchant account with a licensee of  VISA Europe and MasterCard in Denmark and through this gateway DataCell received donations for WikilLeaks.  In December 2010, after only 7 weeks of operation  the Danish licensee terminated its agreement with DataCell  at the order of the card companies, and thereby the gateway for donations to WikiLeaks was closed.</p>

<p>       VISA Europe and MasterCard  together have over  96 % of the  payment card market in Europe  and when these organizations deny  businesses which rely on selling their services on line, access to their  networks they  contravene the  antitrust rules of the  European Union, both as regards the ban on restrictive business practices and the one  that prohibits the abuse of market dominance:</p>

<p> 	Article 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states:</p>

<p>	“ The following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the internal market: all agreements  between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the internal market, and in particular those which:</p>

<p>	(a) directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions;</p>

<p>	(b) limit or control production, markets, technical development, or investment;</p>

<p>	(c) share markets or sources of supply;</p>

<p>	(d) apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage;</p>

<p>	(e) make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts.”</p>

<p>	Article 102 of the Treaty reads:
       “The abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the internal market or in a substantial part of it as incompatible with the internal market insofar as it may affect trade between Member States  shall be prohibited.“ Such abuse may, in particular, consist in: (a) directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions; (b) limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers; (c) applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage; (d) making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts.”</p>

<p>	In its complaint to the Commission DataCell stresses that the card companies have not come up with any objective justification for their refusal to do business with DataCell.  DataCell points out in particular:</p>

<p>(i)	The provision of payment gateway services whereby the holder of a merchant account uses  it  to accept donations or payments on behalf of  businesses or non-profit organisations which do not have their own merchant account is an accepted and a normal business practice.</p>

<p>(ii)	When DataCell applied for a merchant agreement with members of the payment card networks  in Iceland the Central Bank of Iceland  cleared the application without any reservation. Before, the Danish licensee had found DataCell‘s operation to be wholly compliant with  Icelandic law. (Being a  member of the EEA, Iceland‘s law in the field of payment services have to comply with EU law).</p>

<p>(iii)	Neither WikiLeaks nor its Directors, employees or contractors have been indicted, prosecuted or summoned for breach of any civil law, any criminal law provisions or violations of ”ordre public” in any EEA country.</p>

<p>(iv)	As concerns jurisdictions outside the EEA, neither  WikiLeaks nor its Directors, employees or contractors have been subject to official 
indictments, prosecutions, judgements or summons for breach of any civil law, any criminal law provisions or violations of ”ordre public”.</p>

<p>DataCell  operates  a datacenter in Iceland and offers hosting  and computer application services to  individuals and businesses all over the world.  The location of a datacenter  in Iceland means that its entirely powered by renewable energy resources. Due to the huge energy demand of datacenters the source of their energy plays an increasingly important role  when individuals and businesses choose data hosting services.</p>

<h3 class="spip">WikiLeaks releases advertisement coinciding with the six month unlawful banking blockage against it</h3>
<p>Censorship, like everything else in the West, has been privatized.</p>

<p>For six months now, five major US financial institutions, VISA, MasterCard, PayPal, Western Union and the Bank of America have tried to economically strangle WikiLeaks as a result of political pressure from Washington. The attack has blocked over 90% of the non-profit organization&#8217;s donations, costing some $15M in lost revenue. The attack is entirely outside of any due process or rule of law. In fact, in the only formal review to occur, the US Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy C. Geithner found, on January 12, that there were no lawful grounds to add WikiLeaks to a financial blockade.</p>

<center><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/25412550?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="498" height="324" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>
<p>The fact is, the blockade is not just against WikiLeaks. It is against the associative rights and economic rights of every VISA, MasterCard, PayPal and Bank of America account holder, who have been prevented from supporting the organization of their choice. We call on regulators around the world to investigate and de-license these banking institutions. They are not politically neutral and are not obeying the rule of law. When VISA and MasterCard will happily provide services to the Klu Klux Klan, but not to WikiLeaks, it is time to act.</p>

<p>The issue received previous prominence, but the unlawful blockade continues, on Christmas day, the Dec 25 New York Times editorial wrote:</p>

<p><i>The whistle-blowing Web site WikiLeaks has not been convicted of a crime. The Justice Department has not even pressed charges over its disclosure of confidential State Department communications. Nonetheless, the financial industry is trying to shut it down… A handful of big banks could potentially bar any organization they disliked from the payments system, essentially cutting them off from the world economy.
The fact of the matter is that banks are not like any other business. They run the payments system. That is one of the main reasons that governments protect them from failure with explicit and implicit guarantees. This makes them look not too unlike other public utilities.</i></p>

<p>There are still some ways around the blockade. Direct bank transfers that do not use the Bank of America network still work. We also accept Bitcoin donations or you can send a donation via postal mail.

After WikiLeaks announced Thursday that a “workaround” had appeared for those hoping to contribute to the group via credit card, Visa has moved to shut down that channel and reinstitute the card companies’ financial blockade of the secret-spilling group."</p>

<p>“MasterCard is currently in the process of working to suspend the acceptance of MasterCard cards on WikiLeaks,” said James Issokson, a spokesman for the Purchase, New York-based company, in an e-mailed statement today.</p>

<p>The actions are the latest in a series by companies that may crimp access to funds for WikiLeaks. PostFinance, the banking arm of SwissPost, closed a bank account held by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, saying he doesn’t qualify to be a client. Amazon.com Inc. dropped WikiLeaks from its website- hosting service for breaching terms of service.</p>

<i>December 25th 2010</i>
<p>“a bank’s ability to block payments to a legal entity raises a troubling prospect. A handful of big banks could potentially bar any organization they disliked from the payments system, essentially cutting them off from the world economy….</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that banks are not like any other business. They run the payments system. That is one of the main reasons that governments protect them from failure with explicit and implicit guarantees…</p>

<p>What would happen if a clutch of big banks decided that a particularly irksome blogger or other organization was “too risky”? What if they decided — one by one — to shut down financial access to a newspaper that was about to reveal irksome truths about their operations? This decision should not be left solely up to business-as-usual among the banks.”</p>

<i>December 13th 2010</i>
<p>“Representatives from Mastercard and Visa were called before the committee Sunday to discuss their refusal to process donations to the website, reports <a href="http://grapevine.is/Home/ReadArticle/Parliament-Committee-Calls-Ban-on-Wikileaks-Harsh-Operation-on-Freedom-of-Expression" class='spip_out' rel='external'>Reykjavik Grapevine</a>).</p>

<p>"People wanted to know on what legal grounds the ban was taken, but no one could answer it," Robert Marshall, the chairman of the committee, said. "They said this decision was taken by foreign sources."</p>

<p>The committee is seeking additional information from the credit card companies for proof that there was legal grounds for blocking the donations.
Marshall said the committee would seriously review the operating licenses of Visa and Mastercard in Iceland.”</p>
