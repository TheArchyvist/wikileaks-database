We understand that in response to legal threats by convicted fraudster
Nadhami Auchi, the New Statesman:

1) Has censored, in its entirety, an article/blog entry by New
Statesman political editor Martin Bright which linked to the
Wikileaks.org article identified by the following link:

    http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Eight_stories_on_Obama_linked_billionaire_Nadhmi_Auchi_censored_from_the_Guardian%2C_Observer%2C_Telegraph_and_New_Statesman

2) Is considering issuing a settlement statement describing our
content as "containing significant inaccuracies" or similar wording.

We warn you in the strongest terms that we consider such a statement
to be defamatory and a libel.  Such a statement will defame the
professionalism of our investigative reporters and writers. These
include editor Julian Assange, former Pentagon aid John Shaw, and
3rd party reporters whose reports appear, including that of Accuracy
in Media journalist Andrew Walden and UK journalists Mark Hollingsworth,
Anthony Barnett, Martin Bright, Nick Cohen and Philip Delves
Broughton.

Our organization's reputation for professional, accurate investigative
journalism is our primary asset. As both the New Statesman and
Wikileaks are globally read publications, we will consider taking
action against the New Statesman in the most suitable jurisdiction
or jurisdictions. Should such an action occur, we may suggest
Accuracy in Media, The Guardian, The Telegraph and other 3rd party
publications and journalists whose content appears to join the suit.

Nadhami Auchi and/or his representatives have never contacted us to
question or qualify any material appearing in our publications, or
indeed at all. As such we consider his behavior in relation to the
New Statesman linking to our articles a clear mischief. We warn the
New Statesman not make itself a party to this mischief.
