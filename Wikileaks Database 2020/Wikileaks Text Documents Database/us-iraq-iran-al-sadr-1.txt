REO AL HILLAH, IRAQ

2006 JUNE 3


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 
	COA Scimitar continues to be heavily influenced by Iranian entities, particularly SCIRI and BADR Corps.  Iranian sympathizers and proponents from the SCIRI Governor SALIM SALIH MAHDI AL MUSLIMAWI and many of his cabinet members continue to perpetuate sectarian policy and steer gubernatorial decisions. This present political climate proves tenuous for neutral, non-sectarian leadership such as GEN Qais Hamza Abood Al-Mamori, the Babil provincial chief of police.  MOI reconfiguration coupled with militia infiltration and influence constantly pose a threat to his tenure.  Recently, twenty three council members threatened to conduct a fifteen day walk out on the Provincial Council (PC) because of Qais’ continuance as the chief of police.   Additionally, as ISF take the lead in securing Babil Province; armed groups such as Mahdi Militia compete with them, desiring to become a legitimate alternative for the public.  As the coalition force footprint has decreased significantly in southern Babil, AIF freedom of movement will be more prevalent unless IA and IP forces’ patrolling and operations are significantly improved.

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS:
On 2 May at approximately 2250 hours, there was an IDF attack against the Regional Embassy Office (REO), Al Hillah.  It is assessed that one 82mm mortar and one 107mm rocket were fired from northwest of the compound.  The POI for the rocket was MA463986.  QRF was dispatched the next morning based on a Hillah Home Guard sighting of a Chinese rocket.  The rocket landed at MA 452980, and was embedded approximately nine feet into the ground.  Iraqi ISF used a back hoe to unearth it, and Kalsu EOD detonated it on site.


COMMENT:
Two projectiles were fired last year at the REO during this time frame, and the attackers were never apprehended.  It is not known whether the same individuals are responsible.  This attack may be in response to the vehicular accident and accidental shooting of a LN the same day by a US civilian PSD contracting team just on the other side of the Al Hillah river north of Camp Charlie.  There are no counter fire acquisition systems at the REO; therefore POO verification is not likely.

COMMENT:

The actions of the Jabar brothers indicate a concerted network of insurgents which are transporting direct fire weapons for attacks in other areas of Iraq, or most likely in the vicinity of Al Kifil.  The quantity of these weapons indicate a significant threat to CF/ISF operating or passing through the town, most likely in the form of complex attacks initiated either by an IED or RPG fire.

(S//NOFORN)  MAHDI MILITIA IS DRIVING THIS INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN IN RESPONSE TO MAHDI MILITIA RECEIVING INFORMATION FROM UNIDENTIFIED LOCAL IRAQI GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, THAT HIGH RANKING MEMBERS OF MAHDI MILITIA WERE BEING TARGETED BY U.S. FORCES IN MAY OF 2006.  

(S//NOFORN)  MAHDI MILITIA IS UTILIZING UNIDENTIFIED IRAQI POLICE, ARMY, AND TAXI CAB DRIVERS TO REPORT ON WHO IS ENTERING AND LEAVING U.S. AND COALITION FORWARD OPERATING BASES.

COMMENT:

One THT 809 source nearly escaped an assassination attempt recently due to compromise by ISF working with AIF who released his identity.  As MM and other armed groups continue these aggressive tactics, HUMINT operations will be severely degraded.  CF must exercise the utmost caution in safeguarding these sources as well as individuals working on U.S. bases.

COMMENT:
Individuals claiming to possess information on insurgents have recently approached CF compounds IOT identify THT and special operations soldiers.  Attempts by these organizations have even attempted to photograph these individuals on the FOBs/compounds.  Such bold attempts to target the soldiers indicate the enemy’s realization of these soldiers’ value to operations, and their role as combat multipliers.  Special, unconventional considerations for their force protection and anonymity must always be considered in mission planning.

(S//NOFORN)  APPROXIMATELY 40 UNIDENTIFIED MEMBERS OF MAHDI MILITIA, LEFT MAHDI MILITIA AND JOINED HUSSEINIE ((AL SARKHI)).

NO FURTHER INFORMATION.

COMMENT:
The past several months have chronicled certain pockets of Mahdi Militia members becoming increasingly more intolerant of Muqtada Al Sadr’s political dealings.  These dissatisfied factions have called for a more kinetic, violent approach.  These demands have been quelled by Sadr, who has only allowed his most disciplined Special Forces companies to engage Coalition Forces via mainly indirect fire confrontations, then breaking contact.  Expect more MM members to splinter off and conduct independent, unsanctioned attacks against CF, or to join other more dynamic groups.
