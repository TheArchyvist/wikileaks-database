Subject: PR NPSC Facility Fire and Life Safety Review

All, 

A Fire and Life Safety review of the Puerto Rico NPSC was initiated last week by the Headquarters Facilities Management staff.  The review was intended to identify any hazard or deficiency within building to include fire and life safety systems.  The review was concluded May 8, 2008 and a final report was presented today.  The report identifies a number of deficiencies related to egress in the event of emergency, access for emergency vehicles, fire alarm system deficiencies, security lock functionality as well as fire hazard concerns.

Because the safety and security of our employees is our top priority, it is necessary to suspend operations at the PR NPSC until the identified fire and life safety deficiencies are corrected. To this end, an immediate early dismissal of staff is necessary. The facility will remain closed through the weekend and until further notice.  All employees are requested to contact Octel (800-757-6968) prior to reporting for scheduled shifts on Monday in order to receive further information regarding operational status.

Until further notice Administrative Leave will be paid to employees. Any change in pay status will be communicated to staff without delay as management is committed to keeping staff informed as information becomes available.  Please be patient as we work through these issues, we will be diligent about keeping you informed of our activities.  thanks.
