<h2><a href="http://wikileaks.org/gitmo">The Guantanamo Files: 779 classified prisoner dossiers revealed from the world&#8217;s most notorious prison</a></h2>
			<span class="timestamp">2011-04-25</span>
			<p>In thousands of pages of documents dating from 2002 to early 2009 and never seen before by members of the public or the media, the cases of the majority of the prisoners held at Guantanamo &mdash; 758 out of 779 in total &mdash; are described in detail in memoranda from JTF-GTMO, the Joint Task Force at Guantanamo Bay, to US Southern Coand in Miami, Florida.</p>

<p>These memoranda, which contain JTF-GTMO&#8217;s recommendations about whether the prisoners in question should continue to be held, or should be released (transferred to their home governments, or to other governments) contain a wealth of important and previously undisclosed information, including health assessments, for example, and, in the cases of the majority of the 171 prisoners who are still held, photos (mostly for the first time ever).</p>

<h2>Bank of America using Private Intel Firms to Attack Wikileaks</h2>
			<span class="timestamp">2011-02-02</span>
			<p>In a document titled "The WikiLeaks Threat" three data intelligence companies, Plantir Technologies, HBGary Federal and Berico Technologies, outline a plan to attack Wikileaks. They are acting upon request from Hunton and Williams, a law firm working for Bank of America. The Department of Justice recommended the law firm to Bank of America according to <a href="http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201106/6798/Data-intelligence-firms-proposed-a-systematic-attack-against-WikiLeaks" class='spip_out' rel='external'>an article in The Tech Herald</a>. The prosed attacks on WikiLeaks according to the slides include these actions:</p>

<p><img src="squelettes/puce.gif" width="8" height="11" class="puce" alt="-" />&nbsp;<strong>Feed the fuel between the feuding groups.</strong> Disinformation. Create messages around actions of sabotage or discredit the opposing organizations. Submit fake documents and then call out the error.
<br /><img src="squelettes/puce.gif" width="8" height="11" class="puce" alt="-" />&nbsp;<strong>Create concern over the security of the infrastructure</strong>. Create exposure stories. If the process is believed not to be secure they are done.
<br /><img src="squelettes/puce.gif" width="8" height="11" class="puce" alt="-" />&nbsp;<strong>Cyber attacks against the infrastructure to get data on document submitters</strong>. This would kill the project. Since the servers are now in Sweden and France putting a team together to get access is more straightforward.
<br /><img src="squelettes/puce.gif" width="8" height="11" class="puce" alt="-" />&nbsp;<strong>Media campaign to push the radial and reckless nature of WikiLeaks activities</strong>. Sustain pressure. Does nothing for the fanatics, but creates concern and doubt among moderates.
<br /><img src="squelettes/puce.gif" width="8" height="11" class="puce" alt="-" />&nbsp;<strong>Search for leaks</strong>. Use social media to profile and identify risky behavior of employees.</p>

<h2><a href="http://wikileaks.ch/iraq/diarydig/">War Diary: Iraq War Logs</a></h2>
			<span class="timestamp">2010-10-22</span>
			<p>The 391,832 reports (’The Iraq War Logs’), document the war and occupation in Iraq, from 1st January 2004 to 31st December 2009 (except for the months of May 2004 and March 2009) as told by soldiers in the United States Army. Each is a ’SIGACT’ or Significant Action in the war. They detail events as seen and heard by the US military troops on the ground in Iraq and are the first real glimpse into the secret history of the war that the United States government has been privy to throughout.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.collateralmurder.com/">Video: Collateral Murder</a></h2>
			<span class="timestamp">2010-04-05</span>
			<p>WikiLeaks has released a classified US military video depicting the indiscriminate slaying of over a dozen people in the Iraqi suburb of New Baghdad — including two Reuters news staff. Reuters has been trying to obtain the video through the Freedom of Information Act, without success since the time of the attack. The video, shot from an Apache helicopter gun-sight, clearly shows the unprovoked slaying of a wounded Reuters employee and his rescuers. Two young children involved in the rescue were also seriously wounded.</p>
