<h1>Jehovah's People<br>
Theocratically organized for<br>
His Name</h1>
Jehovah has an earthly household, or organization, to<br>
accomplish his work, an organization that appreciates the<br>
importance of his name and in every way seeks to honor it.<br>
(Acts 15:14; Eph. 2:19; 1 Tim. 3:15; Heb. 3:4-6) As he did<br>
in the case of natural Israel, so today Jehovah brings his<br>
people together as an organization. (Ex. 19:5, 6) They are<br>
directed by a "faithful steward" appointed to administer<br>
organizational matters in accord with God's will. (Luke 12:<br>
42) Ancient Israel served as a pattern of how the worldwide<br>
Christian brotherhood of Jehovah's Witnesses in these last<br>
days would be organized as a God-governed people. (Heb.<br>
10: 1) It requires an orderly arrangement to gather the "great<br>
crowd" out of all nations so that they may declare unitedly:<br>
"Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne,<br>
and to the Lamb." (Rev. 7:9, l0; <i>rs</i> pp. 326-8) Today, this<br>
involves a "stewardship from God," an arrangement adminis-<br>
tered through a "faithful and discreet slave."--Col. 1:25;<br>
Matt. 24:45-47; <i>it</i>-2 p. l035.

<h2>Worldwide organization Is God-Governed</h2>
<h3>Jehovah's Witnesses, a distinct people, are gathered<br>
from all nations.</h3>
<dl>
  <dd> They are unified as one flock. (John l0:16) 
    <p> They form an international association of brothers. (1 Pet.<br>
      2:17; 5:9) 
    <p> They have learned to speak the pure language of truth,<br>
      thereby calling on the name of Jehovah. (Zeph. 3:9, 13) 
    <p> They recognize God's authority and his way of doing<br>
      things. (Deut. 32:4; Isa. 33:22)

            practice of carefully reviewing Units 5 (a), 5 (b), and<br>

                matter, they frequently overlook important points. 
                <p> Since the lives of all Christians are precious to<br>
                  Jehovah, the elders cannot afford to be careless or<br>
                  indifferent. You must "render an account." (Heb.<br>

              valuable contribution to the thinking of the judicial<br>

        needed, write to the Society; if the matter is urgent,<br>
        telephone during business hours. 
        <p> Elders serving as a committee of judges should imitate the<br>
          example of Jehovah and Jesus, dealing impartially and<br>

    <h1>Under "the<br>
      Law of the Christ"</h1>
    "The law of the Christ" is not the body of laws that<br>
    formed the Mosaic Law of ancient Israel. (Gal. 6:2; Col. 2:<br>
    13, 14) Since Pentecost 33 C.E., Christians have been "un-<br>
    der law toward Christ." This control is called "the perfect<br>
    law that belongs to freedom."--1 Cor. 9:21; Jas. 1:25; it-2<br>
    p. 221. 
    <p> Jesus did not personally write down a set of laws. Further-<br>
      more, his disciples did not set down laws in the form of a<br>
      code for Christians, using categories and subheadings. Never-<br>
      theless, the Christian Greek Scriptures abound in laws, com-<br>
      mands, and decrees that the Christian is obligated to observe. 
    <p> Some rules of conduct in the Law of Moses have been<br>
      restated in the law of the Christ and are enforceable upon<br>
      Christians. (Acts 15:19-21) other rules of conduct from the<br>
      Law of Moses with their underlying principles, though not<br>
      enforceable in the Christian congregation, are useful to<br>
      Christians as they walk in the way of holiness.--Jas. 2:8, 9. 
    <p> Elders must always seriously consider the guidelines that<br>
      serve to protect the congregation and keep it clean in Jeho-<br>
      vah's sight. They must also treat God's flock with tenderness.<br>
      --Acts 20:28-30; Eph. 5 :25-27.
