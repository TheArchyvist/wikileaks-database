Hello, I am a lawyer in the Legal Department of Stream Global Services, and I am writing to ask you to remove from WikiLeaks a Stream document that contains confidential Stream information. The document can be found at http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Stream_Amsterdam_Dismissal_plan%2C_2009. The document is a draft notice of a layoff at a Stream site, and it appears to contain so me comments and questions from a drafter or reviewer that were not intended to be made public.

The posting of this document violates the privacy of Stream's employees as well as the confidentiality of Stream's internal information.

Alternatively, if you are unable or unwilling to remove the document from the site, I would ask that you let me know who posted it so that I can direct my request to that person.

Thank you.

- Kathryn
