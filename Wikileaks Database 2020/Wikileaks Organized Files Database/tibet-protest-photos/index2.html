      by police officers during a demonstration against the violence in Tibet,
      Sunday, March 16, 2008 near the Chinese embassy in Paris. Violence spilled
      over from Tibet into neighboring provinces Sunday as Tibetan protesters defied
      a Chinese government crackdown while the Dalai Lama warned that the area
      faced "cultural genocide", and appealed to the world for help. (AP Photo/Jacques
