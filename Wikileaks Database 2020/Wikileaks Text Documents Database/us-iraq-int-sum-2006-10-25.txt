REO AL HILLAH, IRAQ

2006 OCT 25

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 

Yesterday’s raid by OCFI/ISOF on the Imam Ali Mosque has left ACF seeking revenge and face saving operations against CF.  Two reports detailing threats of complex attacks along ASR Jackson tonight are indicative of such possible retribution acts.  From a historical/pattern viewpoint, the projected location for this attack is in the town of Al Hindiyah, which is the same town an MP patrol was ambushed on 30 AUG 06.  The leader of that attack as well as this potential attack is Thaimer Hamza Shabooh, a MM cell leader who was significantly burned by RPG back blast during the 30 AUG 06 ambush.  It was assessed that Shabooh and his son fled to a Najaf MM safe house after CF raided his home.

COMMENT:
 (S//REL USA, MCFI)  There have been multiple instances of reporting linking members of the Karbala council to the insurgency. Activity of this kind will continue until the IAs and IPs eliminate corruption and insurgent infiltration from their ranks. This situation is further complicated by the virtually non- existent CF foot print in Karbala which will most likely not be increased.

COMMENT:
 (S//REL USA, MCFI) Iranian intelligence is most likely sponsoring and coordinating the combined effort between these groups. The Hezbollah fighters are probably combat hardened due to the recent conflict with Israel.
