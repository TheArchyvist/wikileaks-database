# The Wikileaks Database Backup Project
A means of archving the files that were leaked on Wikileaks as a backup. These are downloaded to the best of my abilities to try and collect the wiki pages, html files, and other sorts of files, pdfs, whatever I might find within the documents.

Please check out the [The Wikileaks Database Backup Project Wiki](https://github.com/elnarutoe/wikileaks-database/wiki) for further information on the files.
