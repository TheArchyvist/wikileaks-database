<p>By Andy Worthington</p>

<p>In <a href="http://wikileaks.ch/gitmo/" target="_blank">the 
classified US military files</a> 
recently released by WikiLeaks, and identified as Detainee Assessment 
Briefs (DABs), files relating to 765 of the 779 prisoners held at the 
prison since it opened on January 11, 2002 have been released. The other 
14 files are missing, and this article addresses who these prisoners 
are and why their files are missing, and also, where possible, tells 
their stories. As of May 18, this list includes an Afghan prisoner, 
Inayatullah, who &quot;died of an apparent suicide&quot; at the prison, <a href="http://www.southcom.mil/appssc/news.php?storyId=2659" target="_blank">according to the US military</a>.  <br></p>

<p><b>Two suspicious omissions: Abdullah 
Tabarak and Abdurahman Khadr</b> <br></p>

<p>Of the 14 missing stories, just two 
are overtly suspicious. The first of these is the file for <b>Abdullah 
Tabarak Ahmad</b> (ISN 56), a Moroccan who, according to a <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/01/21/1042911381796.html" target="_blank"><i>Washington Post</i></a> 
article in January 2003, &quot;was one of [Osama] bin Laden&#39;s long-time 
bodyguards,&quot; and who, in order to help bin Laden to escape from 
the showdown with US forces in Afghanistan&#39;s Tora Bora mountains in 
December 2001, &quot;took possession of the al-Qaeda leader&#39;s satellite 
phone on the assumption that US intelligence agencies were monitoring 
it to get a fix on their position.&quot; Whether or not there is any 
truth to this story is unknown, as the <i>Post</i>&#39;s source was a number 
of &quot;senior Moroccan officials,&quot; who have visited Guantánamo, 
and had interviewed Tabarak. One official said, &quot;He agreed to be 
captured or die. That&#39;s the level of his fanaticism for bin Laden. It 
wasn&#39;t a lot of time, but it was enough.&quot; Moroccan officials also 
stated that Tabarak, who was 43 years old at the time, &quot;had become 
the &#39;emir,&#39; or camp leader,&quot; at Guantánamo.  <br></p>

<p>One sign of Tabarak&#39;s supposed significance 
is that, when representatives of the International Committee of the 
Red Cross visited Guantánamo in October 2003, he was one of four prisoners <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/documents/GitmoMemo10-09-03.pdf" target="_blank">they were not allowed to visit</a>. However, the problem with this is not that 
they were refused access to him, but that he was no longer present at 
Guantánamo. Although it was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3528324.stm" target="_blank">reported 
in August 2004</a> that he had 
been released from Guantánamo at that time with four other Moroccans, 
it actually transpired that he had been released 13 months earlier, 
on July 1, 2003.  <br></p>

<p>The reason for this is unknown, although 
in January 2006, in another article in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/29/AR2006012901044.html" target="_blank"><i>Washington 
Post</i></a>, Tabarak&#39;s attorney, 
Abdelfattah Zahrach, &quot;said his client&#39;s importance as an al-Qaeda 
figure ha[d] been exaggerated, although he acknowledged that Tabarak 
knew bin Laden and worked for one of his companies.&quot; Zahrach stated,</p>

<p>&quot;He was in bin Laden&#39;s environment, but he didn&#39;t play an operational 
role. Do you think that if he was really the bodyguard of bin Laden 
that the Americans would have let him come back to Morocco?&quot; In 
response to this question, others in Rabat who were &quot;familiar with 
Tabarak&#39;s case&quot; told the <i>Post</i> that &quot;Moroccan officials 
had pressed the US military for many months to hand over Tabarak, arguing 
that they would have a better chance of persuading him to reveal secrets 
about al-Qaeda.&quot;  <br></p>

<p>The truth may never be known, but Tabarak&#39;s 
missing file suggests that there were some secrets that were regarded 
as off-limits to general readers of the Guantánamo DABs in the US intelligence 
circles with access to them &mdash; focused, presumably, on the 13 months 
between his real date of his release, and his stated date of release. <br></p>

<p>The second suspicious missing file 
is that of <b>Abdurahman Khadr</b> (ISN 990), listed as Abdul Khadr. 
A Canadian, and the brother of Omar Khadr (ISN 766), he was persuaded 
to work as a spy, as I explained in my book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Guantanamo-Files-Stories-Detainees-Americas/dp/0745326641" target="_blank"><i>The </i><i>Guantánamo</i><i> Files</i></a><i>:</i> <br></p>

<p>      Abdurahman 
was captured by Afghans in Kabul in November 2001, when he  was 20 years 
old, and was then handed over to the Americans. Describing  himself as 
the &quot;black sheep&quot; of the family, who saw no value in the radical 
 beliefs of the rest of his family, Abdurahman agreed to work as a spy 
for the  CIA in Kabul, and then in Guantánamo, but was told that, to 
protect his cover,  he would have to be treated like all the other prisoners. 
He said that his  imprisonment at Bagram &mdash; where he was stripped, photographed 
naked and  subjected to an anal probe &mdash; was the start of &quot;the longest 
and most painful  ordeal of his life,&quot; and that he &quot;had no 
idea what he was getting into.&quot;  <br></p>

<p>      After 
ten days at Bagram, he was flown to Guantánamo, where, he said, he 
 arrived &quot;a broken man,&quot; and was then kept in isolation for 
a month before  being moved to a cell near other prisoners. The plan, 
as he described it, was  that &quot;they could put me next to anyone 
that was stubborn and that wouldn&#39;t talk  and I would talk him into it. 
Well, it&#39;s not that easy &mdash; lots of people won&#39;t talk to  anyone because 
everybody in Cuba is scared of the person next to him. I  couldn&#39;t do 
a lot for them.&quot; Unable to cope with his situation, he spent the 
rest  of his time in Guantánamo in a &quot;luxurious&quot; private cell, 
and was then sent to  Bosnia, where his mission was to infiltrate radical 
mosques and gather  information on al-Qaeda&#39;s activities.  <br></p>

<p>      When 
the CIA wanted to send him to Iraq, however, he decided that he  couldn&#39;t 
take the pressure any more, and after resigning from the agency he  returned 
to Canada, where his most salient comments concerned the  prisoners in 
Guantánamo. He said that he told the CIA that the vast majority of 
 the prisoners were innocent, and that it was &quot;a huge mistake for 
the US  military to offer large cash rewards for the capture of al-Qaeda 
suspects when  they first arrived in Afghanistan.&quot;  <br></p>

<p><b>The US &quot;enemy combatant&quot;: 
Yasser Hamdi</b> <br></p>

<p>One other missing file relates to <b>
Yasser Hamdi </b>or Yaser Hamdi (ISN 009), identified as Himdy Yasser 
in the files, who was one of around 80 survivors of <a href="http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/the-guantanamo-files-website-extras-the-qala-i-janghi-massacre/" target="_blank">a massacre in the Qala-i-Janghi fort</a> in Mazar-e-Sharif in November 2001. This came 
about after several hundred prisoners had surrendered, as part of the 
fall of the city of Kunduz, apparently on the basis that they would 
be allowed to return home after doing so. However, after being transported 
to the fort, some of the men started an uprising, because of their betrayal, 
or because they feared that they were about to be killed, which was 
then suppressed savagely. Hamdi and the other survivors hid in the basement 
for a week, where they were bombed and, finally, flooded.  <br></p>

<p>Hamdi was initially regarded as a Saudi, 
even though he had told a journalist on his emergence from the basement 
that he was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. When it finally dawned on 
the US authorities that they were holding an American citizen at Guantánamo, 
Hamdi, who retained his US citizenship, although he had moved to Saudi 
Arabia as a child, was immediately moved to the US mainland (on April 
5, 2002), where he was <a href="http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2008/12/04/the-last-us-enemy-combatant-the-shocking-story-of-ali-al-marri/" target="_blank">one 
of only three US citizens or residents</a> 
held as &quot;enemy combatants&quot; &mdash; along with <a href="http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2007/09/04/jose-padilla-more-sinned-against-than-sinning/" target="_blank">Jose Padilla</a> 
and <a href="http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2008/07/20/court-confirms-presidents-dictatorial-powers-in-case-of-us-enemy-combatant-ali-al-marri/" target="_blank">Ali al-Marri</a> &mdash; and subjected to profound isolation, sleep 
deprivation and sensory deprivation (in other words, torture), until 
he was repatriated to Saudi Arabia in September 2004 &mdash; and stripped 
of his citizenship &mdash; after he won a landmark case in the US Supreme 
Court (<a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2003/2003_03_6696" target="_blank"><i>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</i></a>, in which the Court rejected the government&#39;s 
attempts to detain him indefinitely without trial). <br></p>

<p><b>The late arrivals &mdash; in 2007 and 
2008</b> <br></p>

<p>Three other missing files relate to 
three of the last six prisoners brought to Guantánamo, between March 
2007 and March 2008, two of whom are, according to the US authorities, 
regarded as &quot;high-value detainees.&quot;. I am unsure why these 
files are missing, as files are available for the three other prisoners 
who arrived at Guantánamo during this period. <br></p>

<p>The first of these three (and the first 
of the two missing &quot;high-value detainees&quot;) is <b>Nashwan Abd 
Al-Razzaq Abd Al-Baqi</b>, more commonly known as Abd Al-Hadi Al-Iraqi 
(ISN 10026), who is referred to repeatedly in the Detainee Assessment 
Briefs, and the third to arrive (and the other &quot;high-value detainee&quot;) 
is <b>Muhammad Rahim</b> (ISN 10029), an Afghan. <br></p>

<p>This is how they were described in 
the United Nations&#39; “Joint Study on Global Practices in Relation to 
Secret Detention in the Context of Counter-Terrorism,” a detailed 
report issued in February 2010 (<a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/13session/A-HRC-13-42.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>, or see <a href="http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2010/06/15/un-secret-detention-report-part-one-the-cias-high-value-detainee-program-and-secret-prisons/" target="_blank">here</a>): <br></p>

<p>      On 
27 April 2007, the Department of Defense <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=10792" target="_blank">announced</a> that another high- value detainee, 
Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi, described as “a high-level member of Al- Qaida”, 
had been transferred to Guantánamo. On the same day, Bryan  Whitman, 
a Pentagon spokesman, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-04-27-alqaeda-capture_N.htm" target="_blank">stated</a> that the detainee had been 
 transferred to Defense Department custody that week from the CIA although 
 he “would not say where or when al-Iraqi was captured or by whom”. 
 However, a United States intelligence official stated that al-Iraqi 
“had been  captured late last year in an operation that involved many 
people in more than  one country”. Another high-value detainee, Muhammad 
Rahim, an Afghan  described as a close associate of Osama bin Laden, 
was transferred to  Guantánamo on 14 March 2008. In <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11758" target="_blank">a press release</a>, the Department of  Defense 
stated that, “prior to his arrival at Guantánamo Bay, he was held in  CIA custody”. 
According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/15/washington/15detain.html?_r=1" target="_blank">reports</a> in Pakistani newspapers, he 
was captured  in Lahore in August 2007. <br></p>

<p>      The 
Government of the United States provided no further details about where 
 the above-mentioned men had been held before their transfer to  Guantánamo; 
however, although it is probable that al-Iraqi was held in  another country, 
in a prison to which the CIA had access (it was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/world/24intel.html" target="_blank">reported in  March 2009</a> that he “was captured by 
a foreign security service in 2006” and  then handed over to the CIA), 
the Department of Defense itself made it clear  that the CIA had been 
holding Muhammad Rahim, indicating that some sort of  CIA “black site” 
was still operating. <br></p>

<p>The second to arrive (who is not regarded 
as a &quot;high-value detainee&quot;), is <b>Inayatullah</b> (ISN 10028), 
another Afghan, whose arrival at Guantánamo 
was announced on September 12, 2007. As I explained in <a href="http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2007/09/20/myopic-pentagon-keeps-filling-guantanamo/" target="_blank">an article at the time</a>: <br></p>

<p>      Captured, 
according to the DoD’s press release, “as a result of ongoing DoD 
 operations in the struggle against violent extremists in Afghanistan,” 
the DoD  claimed that Inayatullah had “admitted that he was the al-Qaeda 
Emir of  Zahedan, Iran, and planned and directed al-Qaeda terrorist operations,” 
 adding that he “collaborated with numerous al-Qaeda senior leaders, 
to  include Abu Ubaydah al-Masri and Azzam, executing their instructions 
and  personally supporting global terrorist efforts.” (Al-Masri and 
Azzam were not  identified in the DoD’s press release, but the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/07/AR2007090702056.html" target="_blank">former</a> 
is an Egyptian-born al- Qaeda commander in Afghanistan’s Kunar province, 
and the latter is probably  the American Adam Gadahn, known as <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/01/22/070122fa_fact_khatchadourian" target="_blank">Azzam the American</a>, who has  produced al-Qaeda 
propaganda with Ayman al-Zawahiri). <br></p>

<p>On May 18, 2011, it 
was reported that Inayatullah had &quot;died of an apparent suicide,&quot; 
according to <a href="http://www.southcom.mil/appssc/news.php?storyId=2659" target="_blank">a 
news release issued by US Southern Command</a>. 
The news release also stated, &quot;While conducting routine checks, 
the guards found the detainee unresponsive and not breathing. The guards 
immediately initiated CPR and also summoned medical personnel to the 
scene. After extensive lifesaving measures had been exhausted, the detainee 
was pronounced dead by a physician.&quot; <br></p>

<p>As it transpired, the death could have been avoided, had the authorities been concerned to act on information that, according to the dead man&#8217;s attorney, was readily available to them. Paul Rashkind, a federal defender in Miami, <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/05/19/2225064/guantanamo-suicide-had-long-history.html" class='spip_out' rel='external'>explained</a> that his client, whose real name was Hajji Nassim, "had never been known as Inayatullah anywhere but in Guantánamo, had never had a role in al-Qaeda and ran a cellphone shop in Iran near the Afghan border.” He also explained that he "suffered significant psychosis, a paralyzing psychosis beginning many years ago, long before he got to Gitmo,” and that he had previously attempted to commit suicide twice. Rashkind <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/05/20/ap/latinamerica/main20064741.shtml" class='spip_out' rel='external'>told the Associated Press</a> that that he was “not permitted to provide details” about either of his client’s two previous suicide attempts, “except to say both were serious,” although he did explicitly state, “He was close to death the first time.”</p>

<p><b>The eight others, released between 
2003 and 2005</b></p>

<p>And finally, eight of the missing files 
seem to refer to generally Insignificant prisoners: <br></p>

<p>The first, <b>Badshah Wali</b> (ISN 
638), an Afghan released in March 2003, is known about because he is 
the brother of Niaz Wali (ISN 640), also released in March 2003. As 
I explained in <i>The </i><i>Guantánamo</i><i> Files</i>, &quot;Two brothers from Khost 
<br />&mdash;&nbsp;39-year old Niaz Wali, a cobbler, and 24-year old Badshah Wali, a 
taxi driver &mdash; were &#39;targeted for arrest by local people, who were their 
enemies from another Pashtun tribe.&#39; On their release in March 2003, 
they were &#39;too scared to talk about their experiences.&#39;&quot; The quotes 
are from an article, &quot;A Tough Homecoming,&quot; published in the 
Institute for War and Peace Reporting&#39;s &quot;Afghan Recovery Report,&quot; shortly after their release. In the Detainee Assessment Briefs released 
by WikiLeaks, it was revealed for the first time that <a href="http://wikileaks.ch/gitmo/prisoner/640.html" target="_blank">Niaz Wali (Neyaz Walijan)</a> 
was seized during &quot;a routine search&quot; of his home because &quot;local 
security forces&quot; &quot;discovered a large, thick hard cover book.&quot; 
When &quot;questioned about the nature of the book,&quot; Niaz Wali 
&quot;was unaware of its existence.&quot; On the basis of this book, 
he was taken into US custody, and when his brother, Badshah Wali (Patcha 
Walijan) &quot;freely vsited&quot; him at his place of detention &quot;to 
inquire about the book,&quot; he was &quot;told to mind his own business.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shortly thereafter,&quot; he too was seized.  <br></p>

<p><b>Haji Mohammed Wazir</b> (ISN 996), 
a 60-year old Afghan, was 
released in March 2004 with 22 other Afghans. A farmer from Helmand 
province, he spent a year in Guantánamo and was held for two and half 
years in total. <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0316-03.htm" target="_blank">Speaking 
briefly to reporters</a> 
on his release, he said, “I’m a poor and innocent man. I was in 
my home, unaware of Taliban and al-Qaeda, when I was caught. If I’m 
a Taliban or al-Qaeda I want to be punished. If I’m not, then they 
should compensate me. The two-and-a-half years that I have spent in 
pain and soreness &mdash; who is going to pay?”  <br></p>

<p><b>Mirwais Hasan</b> (ISN 998) is an 
Afghan, <a href="http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/detaineesFOIArelease15May2006.pdf" target="_blank">apparently born 
in 1980</a>, who was released in 
March 2004, but nothing else is known about him. <br></p>

<p><b>Reda Fadel El-Waleeli</b> (ISN 663), 
identified by the US as Fael Roda Al-Waleeli, is an Egyptian, apparently 
born in 1966. The first Egyptian transferred from Guantánamo to Egypt, 
he arrived in Cairo on July 1, 2003, and subsequently disappeared. As 
I explained in <a href="http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2011/04/01/torture-and-terrorism-in-the-middle-east-its-2011-in-america-its-still-2001/" target="_blank">an article 
in April this year</a>: <br></p>

<p>      In 
October 2009, Martin Scheinin, the UN Special Rapporteur on the  promotion 
and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while  countering 
terrorism, <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/13session/A-HRC-13-37-Add2_sp.pdf" target="_blank">complained</a> that, after a visit to Egypt in April 2009, 
he  “regrets that the Government of Egypt did not reply to his questions 
on the fate  of … El-Weleli,” although I was later told that UN representatives 
finally  succeeded in tracking him down, and that he was a broken figure, 
and very  obviously a threat to nobody, who explained that, after his 
return from  Guantánamo, he had been held and tortured in a secret prison 
in Egypt for  three and a half years. <br></p>

<p><b>Ayman Mohammad Silman Al-Amrani</b> 
(ISN 169) is a Jordanian, <a href="http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/detaineesFOIArelease15May2006.pdf" target="_blank">apparently 
born in 1978</a>, who was released 
in November 2003, but nothing else is known about him. <br></p>

<p><b>Hammad Ali Amno Gadallah</b> (ISN 
705), from Sudan, is the only one of these eight released after September 
2004. He was freed in July 2005, and, like all the prisoners released 
after September 2004, was subjected to a Combatant Status Review Tribunal, 
whose results were released by the Pentagon in 2006. He was one of five 
prisoners working for the Revival of Islamic Heritage Society (RIHS), 
a Kuwait-based NGO, with branches around the world, who were seized 
in 2002 after the Pakistani and Afghan branches of RHS were blacklisted 
by the US government. This is how I described his story in <i>The </i><i>Guantánamo</i><i> Files</i>: <br></p>

<p>      32-year 
old Hamad Gadallah (released in July 2005) told the most complete  story 
of the organization&#39;s activities, and obviously managed to impress upon 
 the Americans that not everyone who worked for the charity was siphoning 
off  money for al-Qaeda. Arrested at his home on 27 May 2002, by two 
Americans  and representatives of Pakistani intelligence and the police, 
he explained that  he had been working for the Central Bank in Sudan, 
when his brother, who  worked for a bank in Bangladesh, told him that 
the RIHS in Peshawar had a  vacancy for an accountant. He took leave 
from his job to investigate the  organization in January 2001, and, after 
seeing that they were &quot;all good  people, with high standards, [who] 
love their work, and ... perform their work  faithfully,&quot; and that 
there were &quot;no problems with the accountancy  programme,&quot; he 
handed in his notice at the bank and began working for the  RIHS in March.  <br></p>

<p>      Refuting 
allegations about the organization&#39;s inclusion in a US guide to  terrorist 
organizations, he said, &quot;I say that not every organization or person 
 that is within that guide can be accused of being a terrorist. That 
requires a lot  of evidence and proof ... I&#39;m sure that the year that 
I was working for the RIHS  in 2001, it had nothing to do with any terrorist 
acts.&quot; He added that the  organization had an income of around two 
and a half million dollars in 2001,  which came from mosques in Kuwait, 
and described it as a &quot;huge  organization&quot; with one branch 
in Pakistan. He also explained the significance  of his role and, crucially, 
how there were no underhand financial transactions  during his time there: <br></p>

<p>      <b>Q</b>: 
If your organization were transferring money to another organization, 
you  would be aware of it?</p>

<p>      <b>A</b>: 
That never happened.</p>

<p>      <b>Q</b>: 
But if it had, you would know that?</p>

<p>      <b>A</b>: 
Yes I would. Because I record everything that comes in and everything 
that  goes out.  <br></p>

<p><b>Sadee Eideov</b> (ISN 665) is a 
Tajik, <a href="http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/detaineesFOIArelease15May2006.pdf" target="_blank">apparently born 
in 1953</a>, who was released in 
March 2004, but nothing else is known about him. <br></p>

<p><b>Shirinov Ghafar Homarovich</b> (ISN 
732), also identified as Abdughaffor Shirinov, is one of three Tajiks 
seized in a raid on an improvised dorm in the library of Karachi University, 
where he was working, and where he allowed two of his compatriots to 
stay. Files exist for the other two &mdash; <a href="http://wikileaks.ch/gitmo/prisoner/729.html" target="_blank">Muhibullo 
Umarov (Moyuballah Homaro)</a> 
and <a href="http://wikileaks.ch/gitmo/prisoner/731.html" target="_blank">Mazharuddin</a> &mdash; and all three were released in April 2004. 
This was how I explained their story in <i>The </i><i>Guantánamo</i><i> Files</i> (via an article in <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2006/09/man-who-has-been-america-one-guantanamo-detainees-story" target="_blank"><i>Mother Jones</i></a><i>)</i>, 
and the files for Umarov and Mazharuddin reinforce this explanation 
of how they were seized by mistake: <br></p>

<p>      In 
2006, the journalist McKenzie Funk met Umarov by chance while reporting 
 from Tajikistan, when a farmer in the remote Obihingou valley told him, 
 &quot;There&#39;s a man in the valley who has been to America. Really. He 
was in a  prison. They made a mistake.&quot; After tracking Umarov down 
to his tiny, mud- walled home, Funk heard how, during the civil war, 
when he was 14 years  old, his father took him and his two younger brothers 
to Pakistan and installed  them in madrassas for the duration of the 
war.  <br></p>

<p>      Six 
years later, he returned to his home village, diploma in hand, and began 
 helping the family with their harvest of apples, potatoes and walnuts, 
&quot;but then  America bombed Afghanistan and the whole world went crazy.&quot; 
Sent back to  Pakistan to raise money to bring his brothers home, he 
found odd jobs in the  bazaar in Peshawar and on 13 May 2002, in search 
of a better job, set off for  Karachi, where his friend Abdughaffor Shirinov, 
who was working at the  library, had a place for him to stay. Mazharuddin 
was also staying there, and  at night the three men hung their T-shirts 
on the bookcases and slept on thin  carpets on the floor.  <br></p>

<p>      Six 
days after his arrival, in the wake of Pakistan&#39;s first suicide bombing, 
 Pakistani intelligence agents raided the library, using the men&#39;s T-shirts 
to tie  them up and blindfold their eyes, and took them away. Held for 
ten days by  the Pakistanis, Umarov was moved to secret prison &mdash; in 
what appeared to be  a luggage factory &mdash; that was run by Americans, 
where he was questioned  about al-Qaeda and was locked them up for ten 
days in a concrete cubicle  that was only a metre long and half a metre 
wide, and was &quot;insufferably hot.&quot;  &quot;All my thoughts were 
about how my life was going to end,&quot; he told the  journalist. He 
was then returned to his friends in the Pakistani jail, and the  following 
day the three men were transported to Kandahar.</p>
