By summer's end I may be moving out to Oregon. My current girlfriend grew up there and wants to go back. I escaped this state once, I may do it again. Again Sir, thanks for being patient while I am getting things back on track.  88!

Fuck You!
Prose by Hardy Lloyd
(written on 11th of May, 90fe)
 
www.hardylloyd.com
 
You think I care about you?
Well, you are DEAD wrong!
I’ll kill you dead and rape your wife too!
You think I need you?
You ain’t even my dad!
I’ll cut your nigger loving balls off and make ya eat them!
Your faith makes you my slave!
While I am free to kill and enjoy it!
That’s right, High Priest, I enjoyed what I did!
Thrice I headed the call of the WOLF!
Thrice I killed!
Nye was I wounded for it but once!
The animal that I am LIVES, while you sleep your dreams of Smith!
HA HA HA HA HA HA
Sheep you are; Wolf am I!
FUCK YOU!
I’ll kill and kill again and again… Until the world falls into flames of my hatred!
My mind has the plan, and I shall destroy that which you love!
FUCK YOU! You are weakness; I am the strong of the Universes will!
In your head the snow falls… For a child of Smith is what you wanted…
But I was too much for your Deseret soul to love!
But you gave me the learning to start the war…
You gave me my push…
You opened the door…
YOU, you brainwashed me!
Without you I would never have found my HATE; my fuel!
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
JA! Sei Fromm?
HA HA HA HA HA HA
FUCK YOU!
I am your worst nightmare!
I am of different flesh and soul and MIND!
You think I wont kill you, or my friend?
Killing is the only true state of happiness in life!!
I will come for you all!
Knife in hand, alibi in pocket, bought pig with cash…
And you will die a slow death!
I have a key to your house!
HA HA HA HA – JA!
Sei Fromm? NEIN!
FUCK YOU!
I’ll send you to that heaven you pray for!
FUCK YOUR BOOK!
FUCK YOUR CHURCH!
FUCK YOUR LIFE!
YOU AIN’T EVEN MY DAD, ASSHOLE!!
You are dead to me!

Sir- I have finally gotten my life back to where it used to be. Things are actually OK. But even though circumstances were outside of my control, I have been neglecting my duties to the NSM. Please accept my apologies Jeff. The NSM has meant everything to me since I first joined over 2 years ago. My life has been a fucking roller coaster the last 6 months, but shit is back to normal now. I have 2 jobs working over 60 hours a week, and I feel like I have finally gotten past the shit I went through. It was hell man.
 
After that shit with Angela happened, I had no one and nothing to back me up- my entire life was utterly fucked. But I am back and better than ever. I feel great and life is good. I bought a laptop, and if you would like me to resume my former duties helping you with emails, I would be more than happy to assist.
 
On another note- I am embarressingly behind on my Party dues. Please do not think this is because I stopped giving a shit! Jeff, life has kicked the living shit out of me for the last year or so, and although I was always loyal to yourself and the NSM, I let all the bullshit get to me and I almost went to my knees. It was that bad man.
 
I consider you a Brother Jeff and my position in the NSM with the SS is the best thing in my life. Please understand that I have in no way ignored or left my duties behind. Life decided to kick my ass for awhile and now it is over. You all are my family and I feel that in a way I have let you down. I will always stand beside, no matter what.
 
As far as my dues are concerned: I get paid on Tuesday. Consider it done.  The NSM is the best thing that ever happened to me, and I feel ashamed that I let a pile of horrible bullshit come between me and the people I love the most.
 
88 Commander Schoep!

Hey there stranger. I hope it doesn't seem weird that I am still writing to you. I am ok, I guess. Working, doing what I have to, etc.... I still love you and Ian and I hope that you and him are doing well. Angela- I'm sorry for everything baby. I miss you so much. You and I can never be together again, but that doesn't mean that I can just stop caring for you.

I hope that you are safe and happy. Whatever happens in your life honey, I hope you are happy. I don't have any bad feelings towards you, although some say I should. But thats just not how I am. The time I spent with you here and in Missouri was the best time of my life. I sincerely hope that you and Ian have a happy and fulfulling life. I sure as hell would not want anything bad to happen to you baby. You may not believe it, but I still love you as much as I did the first time I said it.

By the way- I am celebrating today- 75 days without a drink! I feel pretty goddamn good about that! It makes me feel good. I don't need that shit. I never needed it. Just one of those things I guess. Ihope this reaches you. The last few I have sent came back "unsent". Whatever. For what it's worth- I love you Angela. I really, really do. Please tell my boy that his Daddy loves and misses him.

Take care of yourself and be careful sweetheart. I love you.

Sir- I don't know if you got my last message or not. I am doing as well as I can. I am currently living with double-pnuemonia and living in a homeless shelter working a shitty part time job. Things are just fucking great! The current situation I am in is not necessarily my fault. I wanted you to know that I am still firmly behind the NSM in every way, but my life is a total fucking train wreck at the moment.
(Thank you Angela, you fucking whore....)

It is not a certainty that I will make it to Nationals this year. I am having a hard time buying toothpaste at the moment. Recently I was so goddamn ashamed of myself that I wanted to quit the NSM. But bad things happen to everyone from time to time and this shit will pass eventually. But Jeff I gotta be honest- the last 6 months have beaten the shit out of me. This was not my fault, but it is what it is....

I love the NSM and I am proud to be a part of it Sir.Please allow me a little time to get my shit together and I will be back on top of things. When I left Angela's cheating, slutty ass I had nothing and I still have nothing. I am doing absolutely everything I can to change that. Whatever happens Commander, I will always stand behind the NSM and all of it's members. I need a little time to put things back together.

                                                                                           Sincerely,

Hope all is well with you. I am fine, for the most part. Working 2 jobs now and will soon be getting my own place and car once again. Kailey and I are building a great relationship, but it will take some time. I should never have left her. Apparently, Eric is not being much of a father to her and is treating Lisa like shit, so she left him. Life is crazy....
 
They shut down "Up the Creek" and are turning it into an Applebees. Tim asked me if I wanted to come and work for him as his assistant kitchen manager- I said "Fuck yes!!" hahaha! So money will soon cease to be an issue. Thank god- I was starting to get worried.
 
Please give my little man a kiss for me and tell him his Daddy loves and misses him. Unless of course you have already replaced me...ha! Best of luck to you and all that you do Angela. And please be careful- you never know what kind of sick fucks you will run into at one of these little "get togethers" you go to.

I am moving the fuck out of here day after tomorow. I will not be online for some time until I can get everything set up. I have been so stupid Jeff. I came all the way here because I loved her and she has utterly and completely fucked me over royally.

I remain devoted and loyal to the NSM, but due to the current clusterfuck I will not be able to assist HQ online for some time. My sincere apologies Sir. Never saw this shit coming.

Thanks for your email! Our plan is very simple- we engage in public speaking events, participate in local and state elections, distribute information and literature, etc.... It is a daunting task, no doubt of that,but we are up to it. Our plan is to convince others that this system is broken beyond repair and that the principles of National Socialism are superior to this "democracy" we find ourselves in.

There are decades of work to be done, but it is something that must be done or this country and this race will be disappear forever. We want to appeal to American's sense of logic and reason, if they have any left.
Eventually, we hope to gain seats in state and national government. Our plan is to win legally and honestly with none of the double-speak and obfuscations used by today's politicians. We do not lie or sugarcoat anything- perhaps something that appeals to politics-weary Americans.....

SS Herring,
 
Are you keeping up on the staff mails I send (remember I said I would ask every so often)?
 
I have been able to keep up on most of them, but here is one for you. This guy actually sent a letter in super long, and I don't have time to answer his million questions. He sounds like a good guy, but he is really worried about zog finding out if he joins us. Name is Brooks Batson from Oregon, his e-mail is Nordic@operamail.com  Please contact him as NSM HQ Staff and see if you can answer his questions please. He is a long time member of the Council of Conservative Citizens but is looking for a more serious group (like us), he sent in 3 typed pages. Alright thanks again.
 
It was good seeing you and your Family at the MO. Rally, always a pleasure. 88

Thanks for writing. Actually, 10 out of 10 times when someone is arrested at our functions it is a protester. You do make excellent points though. I think that this entire "equality" idea is bunk. "Equal" means "the same". We are not all the same. We should of course all be afforded the same opportunities to succeed, not a guarantee that you will be "forced" to succeed simply because of your minority status through legislation. We certainly do live in some very confusing and chaotic times, no doubt of that.

Who is to say that one opinion is correct while another is invalid? I would have to agree with you on that. People tend to think in absolutes these days without realizing the implications of such ideologies.

It is 2am and I just finished a 15 hour day at work, or I would certainly speak with you more tonight. I would enjoy communicating with you anytime. I am always up for a lively conversation. Take care man.

Sincerely,

SS Mann William Herring

I find it amusing in a way, for I have looked at your site, and it seems that, 9 times out of 10, when someone gets arrested at one of your rallies, its a protestor.
 
I will say this. I am not racist (though I am nationalist in the sense that we should take care of america first and other countries second) But I will state that you are correct that Racial equality is a hypocracy, but perhaps in a different way.

What many people dont realize, is that when they say racial equality, they dont realize that they are actually meaning economic, religious, and political equality. They only think that it means they have to treat them as if calling them racist names is "politically wrong" when it isnt, since it isnt the governments decision to say what is politically right or wrong to say (otherwise, they would have been forced to get rid of the NSM)
 
Racial equality when it comes to how we treat and think of them, that cannot be accomplished so long as humans live on this earth. Thats the hypocracy. People think racial equality means treating minorities to the highest standard. It doesnt. It just means giving them the same oppurtunities that any regular person gets. You dont have to treat them as if voicing your opinion will get you in trouble.
 
Interestingly, I also find it funny how convinced of their opinion anti-white groups are. They show the same conviction as white supremecist groups. Goes to show that, in a way, neither side of the spectrum is right, nor is it wrong. It is merely how you view things in life.
 
Hope this doesnt confuse you too much. I can tend to get longwinded in such things.

Thanks for your email. The state that we find our country in is no surprise, considering the administration of the last 8 years. We in the NSM are doing all that we can to ensure that future generations will not have this same mess to clean up.

As for the statement you saw in that magazine, it is simply more liberal claptrap and another evidence that the general public are clueless cattle who live by a huge double standard. The hypocracy is actually quite amusing. Feel free to check out our main website and see if perhaps the NSM is an organization you would consider supporting.

                                                                                       Sincerely,

My name scott and im writing from united kingdom . I have seen most of your website and agree with everything. The aryan race needs this a well organised and loyal organisation like the NSM.I my self belong to a couple of nationalist far right groups in england and regional organiser for south east london. This is because iam sick and tired of the state my country is in because of influence on the young white generation from the muds and  every nationality thinks they can come here and show us no respect they will learn..Gang culture among our own and the niggers is at a all time high all influenced by coons. I would be honoured to join the NSM . As soon as i can print the membership form .

I am certain that we have members in that area, but I need to verify that. Go to our main page and look under the units and contacts section. There you can find a complete listing of all NSM units worldwide with the contact information. 88

SS Mann Herring,
Sorry to bother you again but I wanted to find out if the NSM has any members in the Colorado Springs area?  If so, how can I contact these members or can you pass my email on to them and see if they'll contact me?
 
Thanks for your time.
Respectfully,

No my friend, we encourage all of our members to speak thier mind at all times. At the moment we are nearly overwhelmed by the influx of new membership applications and our staff needs to be expanded to deal with this new flow in a more timely fashion.
 
You are absolutely right Sir- a whole lot of organizations out there are all talk and no balls. We take this fight to the streets all over this country doing all that we can to ensure the survivall of our race. We would be proud to count you amongst our ranks. I will speak with you soon. 88!

Mr. Herring,
I received an email back from the Commander confirming your identity.  If you or someone from NSM would still like to speak with me then please, feel free to give me a call.  If you receive my voicemail please leave me a message and a number I can reach you.  I typically do not answer my phone when I do not recognize the number calling.  I also live in the mountains so I do not get signal on my cell when I am at home.
 
I sent a couple of emails to the Colorado POC but have not heard anything back from them.  I hope I haven't ruffled any feathers by my emails.  I am just tired of the organizations that represent the white race not having the foresight to actually take some action to work toward our goals or some of these idiots who cannot speak intelligently or persuasively and try to take stupid actions that actually hurt our "cause" instead of helping it.  A lot of these organizations are political dinosaurs and they need to either evolve or stay out of the way of those who actually want to accomplish goals for our race.
 
Anyway, I always speak my mind until I see I shouldn't speak my mind.  I hope I haven't angered some in the NSM but if I have, tell them to give me some of their time and I'll convince them I am right.  I convinced a black the other day that society is better when it is segmented into sections of ethnicity so I figure I should be able to convince my own race of the same.  Of course, my plans and ideas are little bit more drastic but not much.
 
I hope to hear from you or the Commander soon.
 
88

My name is William Herring and I am a member of the NSM staff corps. The Commander recieves literally dozens and dozens of emails a week and sometimes it is impossible for him to handle every one. So he often defers this overflow to myself as he trusts my judgement. I am also a member of our Security Team. I moved from Fargo last July down here to Springfield Missouri, but have neglected to change the email address.
 
Its a good trait you have- you are cautious and observant. That is what we look for in a member. It is understandable if you would like to verify my identity. Just drop the Commander a quick message and he will confirm who I am. Talk to you soon my friend. 88!

Well, Roger, we have units in 38 different states. We also have units in several different countries. As far as the rallys are concerned, no one expects our members to make it to every single event, but we all try to make it to at least 2 events a year. We all have families and jobs, so it is understood. The 2 most important events of the year are our National meeting in April and our November 9th rally. Other than that, just try to be active in your own community. Many of us save travel expenses by carpooling and sharing hotel rooms, etc..

First of all, it is not so much the jews as a race that we detest, but the ideology of Zionism that so many of them follow. It is a plague and will ultimately destroy anything and everything that is not jewish. We do tend to focus on the more heinous crimes of non-whites in order to enlighten the public on the dangers of multiculturalism, but at the same time, we must admit to and report on the terrible crimes that many whites comitt in order to show that our race is falling into decadence and that this behaviour is further destroying us.
 
We are not so one-sided as many think. But we do see the root causes for most of society's ills and feel that  the "meat" of the matter must be brought to the forefront. There is not much time left for our race, and the time for half-measures and political correctness is far past.
 
I look forward to speaking with you further Sir, but I am heading out of town for 3 days in about 20 minutes, so I must cut this short. By all means, if you have any further questions, please send them and I will answer much more in depth when I am not so pressed for time.
 
                                                                                 Sincerely,

Comrade Herring,
 
Hopefully no offense was taken on your part by anything you read of mine either in my last email or on my web page.  If so, I apologize.  If you have yet to even have read my previous response to you then I will apologize ahead of time.  My views on religion stem from the National Socialist viewpoint that it DOES NOT belong in the political spectrum.  I have much respect for Aryans of all religious backgrounds but I would never raise my children (if/when I have any) with any sort of religious bias as I believe faith is an adult decision. 
 
Anyhow, for what it is worth, I am still eager to contribute to your movement with the ferver and respect I have for our race and country!  Any response from you is welcomed and I hope you are well. 
 
Cordially,
Mike Cook

The only way to effectively fight the Jewish plague is to beat them at their own game. Education is the key. Educate yourself and become active in state and national politics. Stand up, speak out, and be seen by your countrymen. Have you considered joining our organization? We are always looking for sincere and dedicated white patriots to stand with us.

Heil Comrade- Basically we have several different divisions so that individuals may choose their level of commitment. We have the skinhead division for those who aren't to keen on wearing the uniform. We also have support divisions for those who simply wish to support the Movement financially and don't wish to be seen publically because of career or family concerns.
 
But our Stormtroop division is for those who are sick of this mess and are willing and proud to be seen in public and wave our sacred symbols.

Hey there stranger! Your email for some reason went into the junk box. I just happened to check it before I deleted all of them. Buddy, I moved to Springfield, Missouri in July. I really didn't have much left for me in North Dakota and I missed the hell out of my girl, so I moved to where she lives. I was under the assumption that you were back in the pen for 2 years. Robin told me that you only got 6 months. Sweet... I assume that you are all done now and have no paper or any of that shit. Excellent! We do still need a unit in Fargo and it would be fucking great if you could be our ND contact. Let me know bud, and I'll set it up. 88!

Angela has enrolled in college and I am already working. We are going through a rough spot, but we are Aryans: with hard work we will rise above!

Due to security issues, information concerning rallys is generally kept under wraps until just a week or 2 before hand, as I am sure you can understand. The best way to stay up-to-date it to check out our main web site weekly for updates. Security and the safety of our members is priority #1 and so we must exercise all caution.

As of July 23, I will be moving to Springfield Missouri. It may take a week or two to get internet service hooked up there. Thought it would be a good idea to let you know so that emails are not being answered! Wish me luck Commander!
 
On another note- it seems that the retarded rumors of Angela's children not being white have resurfaced from an unknown party and she is terribly upset. She is unsure how to prove these allegations false except for photos of her babies- blonde hair and blue eyes...
 
Anyway, I will still be ready and able to handle any and all emails forwarded here until July 22nd.

I am a little fucking pissed off!‏

I know that you already deal with drama and crap on a daily, shit, an hourly basis, but I have recently heard a few rumors about myself that have my balls in a knot.
 
But first off Jeff- I love the NSM. I respect the hell out of you and all of our members. I have had the best times of my life with this organization. But it has come to my attention recently that there is a rumor that I am on the verge of being booted for drinking too much, Angela's daughter has been called into question again, etc,etc.... I quit drinking 2 months ago. Haven't touched a drop. I am lifiting weights, jogging, working my ass off to get in shape and I hear that at the Memorial Day event, an individual was telling Angela that I am a fucking drunk and have pretty much been kicked out of the NSM.... I won't mention his name because that is not what this is about.
 
Jeff- I fucking love this organization and I look up to you. I never wanted things to come to this point, but I am FUCKING FURIOUS right now! I have stood up for and supported everyone in the NSM. I consider you guys my family and this is how I am treated? People talking shit about me behind my back? Telling my fiance that she would be better off without me? I was so fucking hurt when I heard that, especially considering who it came from. Is this Aryan unity? An episode of the Jerry Springer show?
 
Yes- I will not lie. I had a drinking problem. And I quit! Absolutely and completly- I fucking quit because it was a betrayal of my oath. We all have our faults, and that was mine. I want to ask the motherfucker who talked behind my back if he may not have tipped the bottle a few times after being beaten nearly to death most of his childhood by a drunken asshole and then spending 8 years in a maximum security prison..... Sometimes, a hug just doesn't fucking cut it!
 
I am sorry if this pisses you off Jeff- but I have not been this fucking angry in a long time! I love you man and I love the NSM. I have been waging an internet war on your behalf for 6 months. That cocksucker Jim Ramm is one of my favorite targets.
 
I have been faithfully doing all I could for the NSM on a "budget" that is laughable at best. I have been down to washing my clothing in the bathtub and using coffee filters for toilet paper- just so I could keep my internet and phone on and continue helping you with these emails. Am I to be discarded because I had a drinking problem? Am I nothing more than some ex-con piece of shit to be thrown away when I am no longer useful?
 
I think that this is the case and it breaks my fucking heart. Commander- I will not ever quit the NSM. i took an oath and you will have to kick my ass out. But my goddamn heart is broken right now and I want to stomp someone's fucking guts out.
 
My life is going great right now. I am happy, healthy and working hard to spread the word and get our message out there. And then I hear this shit! If I really am about to be booted for drinking too much a few months ago, then fine. But I will not resort to slandering the NSM or starting a whole fucking internet page about it. You may not even be aware of this and so I apologize for bothering you with this. But it needed to be brought to your attention.

What you need to do, my young friend, is stay in school and get yourself the best education you can. Continue to spread our message, but more importantly, develop yourself as a young white man.

The Viking Youth is simply a division for the younger members to learn about NS before they jump right into an active division. They must learn our history and heritage so that they can more effectively fight our enemies when they reach adulthood. Our different divisions give people a chance to contribute to the best of thier abilities and so we have these various divisions and different levels of committment in order to more effectively utilize individual's talents.
