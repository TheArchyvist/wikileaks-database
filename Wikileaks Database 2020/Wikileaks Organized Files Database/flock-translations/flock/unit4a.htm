<H1>How the Elders<BR>
Work Together as a Body</H1>

<P></P>

<P></P>

<P>&quot;In the multitude of counselors there is accomplishment,&quot;<BR>
states Proverbs 15:22. A congregation having a body of older<BR>
men who work closely together is indeed blessed. But what is<BR>
the key to their being able to work in unity? Primarily, it is<BR>
their recognizing Jesus Christ as Head of the Christian con-<BR>
gregation.</P>

<P></P>

<P>When elders meet together, Christ's headship should<BR>
dominate. (1 Cor. 11:3) Their meetings should be well<BR>
arranged. ( 1 Cor. 14:40) They should try to reach decisions<BR>
on matters discussed. Definite arrangements should be made<BR>
for someone to follow through on the decisions that are<BR>
made. How can the presiding overseer conduct meaningful<BR>
elders' meetings? What must each individual elder do to<BR>
make a positive contribution to these meetings? But first,<BR>
what is involved in recognizing Christ's headship, and how<BR>
does this unite a body of elders?</P>

<P></P>

<H2>Recognizing the Headship<BR>
of Christ Unites the Body</H2>

<P></P>

<P><B>Although Jehovah God is the Shepherd and Overseer of<BR>
our souls, he has appointed Jesus Christ as Head of the<BR>
Christian congregation. (Eph. 1:22, 23; 1 Pet. 2:25)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>By genuinely accepting Jesus Christ as Head of the Chris-<BR>
  tian congregation, elders will be motivated to do the<BR>
  following:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Let the Bible be the guide in making decisions. (John 7:<BR>
    16, 17)</P>
    <P>Respect information and direction coming from agen-<BR>
    cies used by &quot;the faithful and discreet slave.&quot; (Matt. 24:<BR>
    45-47 )</P>
    <P>Treat the congregation as God's inheritance, not lord-<BR>
    ing it over them. ( 1 Pet. 5 :1-3 )</P>
    <P>64<HR><p></P>
    <P>Avoid imposing personal viewpoints, opinions, or arbi-<BR>
    trary rules on the congregation or the body of elders.</P>
    <P>Deal in a kind and loving manner regarding each indi-<BR>
    vidual in the congregation. (Matt. 11:28-30; John 21:</P>
    <P>Listen carefully to the expressions of fellow elders.<BR>
    (Matt. 18:20; Rom. 12:10b)</P>
    <P>Pray when a discussion among elders seems to falter.</P>
    <P>(For additional information, see The Watchtower, De-<BR>
    cember 1, 1986, pages 10-20. ) .</P>

<P></P>

<H3>Jesus Christ controls all bodies of elders. At Revelation<BR>
1:20 they are likened to seven stars upon his right hand.<BR>
(re pp. 28-9)</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Jesus, by means of God's holy spirit, can influence any<BR>
  elder on the body to provide the Bible-based suggestions<BR>
  needed for any given situation. (Matt. 18:20; Acts 15:<BR>
  13-17)</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>By accepting this fact, elders will be helped to work<BR>
    together as a body.</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Each elder should listen carefully to the Scriptural sugges-<BR>
  tions of the other elders.</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>We should not make an independent decision for the<BR>
    congregation if a matter is one on which we should<BR>
    consult other elders.</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P></P>

<H2>What Enables Elders to<BR>
Display the Spirit of Cooperation</H2>

<P><B>Jehovah, through his Son, unifies the congregation for<BR>
harmonious cooperation. (Eph. 4:16; compare Romans<BR>
8:28.)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Elders are really cooperating with Jehovah when they<BR>
  cooperate as a body for the good of the congregation.<BR>
  (Col. 2:19; 1 Cor. 12)</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Cooperation is a result of displaying the fruitage of the<BR>
    spirit, which every elder should cultivate in his personal<BR>
    life, both publicly and privately. (Gal. 5:22, 23)</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>In the following ways, elders show that they are cooperat-<BR>
  ing together and striving to maintain the unity referred to<BR>
  at Psalm 133:1:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Keeping communication among elders open and free,<BR>
    especially if there are differences in background.</P>
    <P>Sharing pertinent information with fellow elders.</P>
    <P>Not shielding elders or their relatives from needed<BR>
    counsel.</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Seeking assistance and suggestions from elders who<BR>
    have much experience.</P>
    <P>Not campaigning among fellow elders to undermine<BR>
    decisions of the body that do not meet personal prefer-<BR>
    ence.</P>
    <P>Accepting fellow elders' excelling qualities, as well as<BR>
    their limited abilities.</P>
    <P>Not finding fault with fellow elders as they are learning<BR>
    new duties.</P>
    <P>Making sure that reports and records that other elders<BR>
    need to refer to are available and up-to-date.</P>
    <P>Promptly following through to completion on assign-<BR>
    ments given by the body.</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P></P>

<P><B>It should be possible for bodies of elders to be <I>unanimous</I><BR>
in most of their decisions. (Acts 15:25)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>If <I>Bible principles</I> are involved, the elders should make<BR>
  their decision in harmony with these.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>When there is counsel from the faithful and discreet slave<BR>
  on the matter, either by letter or from the Society's<BR>
  publications, the elders will want to take that counsel to<BR>
  heart. (Matt. 24:45)</P>
  <P>Other matters may generally be decided by the majority<BR>
  of the elders on the basis of their sound judgment and of<BR>
  their concern for providing the best guidance and direc-<BR>
  tion for the congregation.</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Even the majority should not insist on a personal<BR>
    viewpoint if such does not take into consideration</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>If elders honor one another, they will not insist that their<BR>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Individual elders will cooperate closely with what the<BR>
    <I>body of elders as a whole</I> determines is in the best<BR>
    interests of the congregation.</P>
    <P>If the majority decide that a matter should be<BR>
    handled in a certain way, then the minority should<BR>
    give willing support to such a decision.</P>
    <P>However, if those in the minority have a Bible<BR>
    reference and comments in print on the matter<BR>
    from the faithful and discreet slave, the majority<BR>
    should recognize such corrective information so<BR>
    that a Bible-based decision can be reached.</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>If in the opinion of the minority a Bible-based<BR>
      decision is still not reached, the minority should<BR>
      continue to cooperate with the rest of the body<BR>
      and bring the matter to the attention of the<BR>
      circuit overseer during his regular visit.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The congregation will cooperate if they sense that all the<BR>

<H2>When Elders' Meetings May Be Held</H2>

<P></P>

<P><B>Meetings are held each year in conjunction with visits of<BR>

<P><B>Three months after each visit of the circuit overseer, a<BR>
meeting can be scheduled. (om p. 42)</B></P>

<H2>How the Presiding Overseer<BR>
Can Prepare for Elders' Meetings</H2>

<P><B>Romans 12:8 says, &quot;He that presides, let him do it in<BR>
real earnest.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>The presiding overseer <I>compiles an agenda</I> of matters that<BR>
need discussion by the whole body of elders.</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>He contacts the other elders individually beforehand to<BR>
  determine what matters they feel need to be added to the<BR>
  agenda and discussed.</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>If practical, in harmony with Proverbs 21:5, he gives a<BR>
    copy of the agenda to each elder far enough in advance<BR>
    of the meeting to allow him to give the points due<BR>
    thought. (1 Cor. 14:40)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>In some cases the elder who recommended an item for the<BR>
  agenda may be asked to take the lead in presenting it for<BR>
  discussion.</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Letting the brother know ahead of time will give him<BR>
    opportunity to prepare a clear presentation of the facts.</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Diligent preparation will keep the length of elders' meet-<BR>
ings to a minimum, allowing more time for other essen-<BR>

<P></P>

<H2>How You Can Prepare for Elders' Meetings</H2>

<P></P>

<P><B>When you receive the agenda prepared by the presiding<BR>
overseer, you should give careful and prayerful thought<BR>
to each point itemized.</B></P>

<P><B>Listed below are some questions that each elder may<BR>
want to ponder in connection with major items on the<BR>
agenda:</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>How did this situation come about?</P>
  <P>What Scriptural principles should guide us in deciding<BR>
  what to do?</P>
  <P></P>
  <P>What direction has been provided by the faithful and<BR>
  discreet slave?</P>

  <P>Is there more that I can do to deal effectively with this<BR>
  matter?</P>
  <P>In what way can the entire body of elders improve its<BR>
  handling of this matter?</P>
  <P>Should this suggestion be put into operation? Why?</P>

<P></P>

<H2>What Matters Might Be Included<BR>
on the Agenda for Elders' Meetings</H2>

<P><B>Spiritual matters should be of principal concern. (Phil.<BR>
1:9-11)</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Appropriate ideas can be obtained by thinking on the<BR>
  shepherding counsel found in the letters to Timothy and<BR>
  Titus and in such passages as Acts 20:17-35 and 1 Peter 5:<BR>
  1-11.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Time may be allowed on the agenda for matters of a<BR>
mechanical, nonspiritual nature also.</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>These should be discussed only when they involve prob-<BR>
  lems that an individual elder, the building committee, or<BR>
  the maintenance committee cannot care for on their own<BR>
  initiative.</P>

<P></P>

<H2>Make Meaningful<BR>
Expressions During Your Elders' Meetings</H2>

<P><B>The presiding overseer should set the pace of the discus-<BR>
sion by keeping the main points to the fore; keep to the<BR>
agenda.</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Conclude each matter before another is opened for discus-<BR>
  sion so that the meeting does not bog down or ramble.</P>
  <P>Make sure that either you or another elder takes notes as<BR>
  to decisions made and who will carry them out.</P>

  <P>There should be no wrath or debates evident in elders'<BR>
  meetings. ( 1 Tim. 2:8 )</P>
  <P>Speak up, use &quot;freeness of speech.&quot; Much time can be<BR>
  wasted if there are long pauses due to a hesitancy to speak.<BR>
  (1 Tim. 3:13)</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>See the listing at the end of this unit. In it are some<BR>
items that you may wish to include on an agenda for<BR>
